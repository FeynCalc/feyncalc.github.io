title: FeynCalc 9.1 released
---

* Many new handy functions: `FCTraceExpand`, `FCTraceFactor`, `FCGetDimensions`, `FCCanonicalizeDummyIndices`, `TarcerToFC`, `FCReplaceD`, `FCColorIsolate`, `FCDiracIsolate`, `DeclareFCTensor`, `UnDeclareFCTensor`, `CommutatorOrder`
* Improved support for using `FeynCalc` with custom `FeynRules`-models (see http://www.feyncalc.org/forum/1042.html for more details)
* `$LimitTo4` is now disabled by default. Even when set to `True`, it is applied only to 1- and 2-point functions (see http://www.feyncalc.org/forum/1077.html for more details).
