title: FeynCalc 9.2 released
---

* New handy functions `FCAbbreviate`, `FCHideEpsilon`, `FCShowEpsilon`, `FCLoopIBPReducableQ`, `FCFactorOut`, `SelectFree2`, `SelectNotFree2`
 * Finally we have shortcuts for spinors with D-dimensional momenta: `SpinorUD`, `SpinorUBarD`, `SpinorVD`, `SpinorVBarD`
 * New option `$KeepLogDivergentScalelessIntegrals` permits consistent 1-loop computations, where UV and IR divergences are regularized with different epsilons.
 * `Examples/FeynRules` now contains several FeynRules models (with more to come) with additional scripts that show how such models can be used with patched `FeynArts`. This should be useful for new users.
 * `DiracTrace` has received a lot of internfal refactoring and should be now faster and much more stable. Thanks to Peng Sun for motivating me to do so. I hope to get `DiracSimplify` refactored as well in the next release.
