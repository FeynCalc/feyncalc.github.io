<h2 id="dirac-traces-in-4-dimensions-and-schouten-identity">Dirac traces
in 4 dimensions and Schouten identity</h2>
<h3 id="see-also">See also</h3>
<p><a href="FeynCalc.html">Overview</a>.</p>
<p>Dirac traces computer in 4 dimensions are not unique. Depending on
the way how such traces are computerd, one may end up with expressions
of different length. The reason for this is the so-called Schouten
identity.</p>
<p>The underlying issue comes from the fact that a totally antisymmetric
tensor with 5 indices must identically vanish in 4-dimensional Minkowski
space, where each index runs only from 0 to 3 This is an obvious
statement, since with this setup you will always have two indices with
the same value between 0 and 3 and so the tensor will vanish by
symmetry.</p>
<p>We can define such a 5-index totally antisymmetric tensor as</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{align}
T^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma\tau} = \varepsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} p^\tau +
\varepsilon^{\nu \rho \sigma \tau} p^\mu +
\varepsilon^{\rho \sigma \tau \mu} p^\nu +
\varepsilon^{\sigma \tau \mu \nu} p^\rho +
\varepsilon^{\tau \mu \nu \rho} p^\sigma,
\end{align}
</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">p</span> is just some arbitrary
4-vector.</p>
<p>It is easy to check that <span
class="math inline">T^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma\tau}</span> is indeed totally
antisymmetric by exchanging any of the two neighboring indices and
adding that to the original expression, e.g.</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{align}
T^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma\tau} + T^{\nu\mu\rho\sigma\tau} = 0
\end{align}
</span></p>
<p>According to the argument above the necessary vanishing of a 5-index
totally antisymmetric tensor in the 4-dimensional spacetime, we must
conclude that</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{align}
\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} p^\tau +
\varepsilon^{\nu \rho \sigma \tau} p^\mu +
\varepsilon^{\rho \sigma \tau \mu} p^\nu +
\varepsilon^{\sigma \tau \mu \nu} p^\rho +
\varepsilon^{\tau \mu \nu \rho} p^\sigma = 0
\end{align}
</span></p>
<p>This relation is known under the name of Schouten identity. We can
also write it in a somewhat different way by noticing that</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{align}
p^\alpha = g^{\alpha \beta} p_{\beta}
\end{align}
</span></p>
<p>which allows us to eliminate the arbitrary vector <span
class="math inline">p</span>. This yields</p>
<p><span class="math display">
\begin{align}
\varepsilon^{\mu \nu \rho \sigma} g^{\kappa \tau} +
\varepsilon^{\nu \rho \sigma \tau} g^{\kappa \mu} +
\varepsilon^{\rho \sigma \tau \mu} g^{\kappa \nu} +
\varepsilon^{\sigma \tau \mu \nu} g^{\kappa \rho} +
\varepsilon^{\tau \mu \nu \rho} g^{\kappa \sigma} = 0
\end{align}
</span></p>
<p>The above demonstrates a nontrivial linear combination of Levi-Civita
and metric tensors that add up to zero. Furthermore, if all indices are
contracted with other tensors or vectors, then recognizing a Schouten
identity in a large expression with many terms becomes a formidable
task. For example, consider multiplying Schouten identity with <span
class="math inline">\varepsilon^{\alpha \beta \gamma \delta}</span>.
Using the formula for products of two Levi-Civita tensors, the amount of
terms on the l.h.s. will increase to 120, still giving zero when added
together.</p>
<p>In practice, not only Dirac traces but any kind of tensor
calculations involving multiple products of Levi-Civita and metric
tensors will sooner or later contain spurious zeros induced by the
Schouten identity. There is no known systematic way to eliminate such
redundancies.</p>
<p>The same issue arises when comparing two expressions that are
expected to be the same but happen to look very different from each
other and even contain a different number of terms. In many cases the
equality can be demonstrated by applying Schouten identity multiple
times in a particular way.</p>
<p>It is somewhat unfortunate that Schouten identity is never mentioned
in most popular QFT books and lectures apart from its variety used in
the spinor-helicity formalism. Hence, there are many particle physicists
who have never heard of it. The FORM manual, however, <a
href="https://www.nikhef.nl/~form/maindir/documentation/trace4">does
mention it</a>.</p>
<p>FeynCalc has a function called <a
href="..//FCSchoutenBruteForce.html">FCSchoutenBruteForce</a> that tries
to automatize the application of Schouten identity in a brute force by
trying all possible combinations and checking which of them lead to the
largest decrease in the number of terms. However, it there is absolutely
no warranty that it can simplify all relevant cases. Often the brute
force procedure gets stuck in the sense, that there is no single
replacement possible that would decrease the number of terms.
Surprisingly, in such cases it often helps to make a replacement that
would actually make the given expression larger. But then one is out of
the pit and the next replacement is most likely to be a good one,
i.e. making the expression much shorter.</p>
<p>Another possibility to show the equality of two expression that
differ by Schouten is to manifestly break the Lorentz invariance by
rewriting everything in terms of single components.</p>
