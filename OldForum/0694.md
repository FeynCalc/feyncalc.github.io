In HQET(Heavy Quark Effective Theory) we come across may loop integrals
where one of the propagators is v.k rather than k.k-m^2. I was wondering
if there is a way for OneLoop to handle these integrals? An example
would be:  

AMP = FAD[{q,m}] 1/(ScalarProduct[q,v]-X);  
OneLoop[q,AMP]  

Gives 0, but the answer by hand is not zero. (X here is just some
constant to displace the propagator.)  

The actual result can be found a number of places:  
(<http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9605342> Equation \# 407)  

Is there a way to input that second part so OneLoop can calculate it?
