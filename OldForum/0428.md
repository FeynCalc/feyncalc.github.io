Dear George,  
try to decompose your arbitrary matrix via 16 linear independent gamma  
matrixes, I, \\gamma^5, \\Gamma^{\\mu}, \\gamma^5 \\gamma^{\\mu},
\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu}.  
After that multiplying by any gamma-matrix using usual rules in
FeynCalc  
will not be problematic.  

Sincerely, Dimitry Fedorov,

Subject: Multiplication of Dirac Gamma matrices by arbitrary matrix  

*\> Dear All,*  
*\> Can I multiply Dirac Gamma Matrices by an arbitrary matrix?*  
*\> When I try to do so, it treats my arbitrary matrix as a matrix but
Gamma*  
as a not matrix but like a just number, it directly multiplies all
elements  
of my arbitrary matrix simply by gamma.  
*\>*  
*\> If I am not clear pls give me your feedbck and I will try to precise
my*  
question.
