I am also having the same problem. I am running on Mathematica 3.0. I
have  
kept the HighEnergyPhysics directory as  
\~/.Mathematica/3.0/AddOns/Applications/HighEnergyPhysics  

After I use \<\<HighEnergyPhysics\`fc\` after invoking Mathematica it
says  

Could not find FeynCalc installation. Quitting the Mathematica  
kernel.  

I shall be grateful if you can suggest a way out.
