Hi,  

the reason I suggested you to use the development version, is that  
FeynCalc 8.2 doesn't work that well with FeynArts. I managed to get it  
work last year,  

<[0768.html](0768.html)>  

but than there were a couple of other glitches which made it quite  
unpleasant.  

In the development version the integration with FeynArts was greatly  
improved due to the new FCPrepareFAAmp function. Moreover, there are  
lots of examples  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/tree/master/FeynCalc/Examples\>  

on generating different diagrams with FeynArts and evaluating them in  
FeynCalc.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
