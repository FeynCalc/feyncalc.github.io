This shortcut is used for technical reasons (to avoid  
the expensive canonicalization of Lorentz indices) by many  
different tools (including FORM), not only FeynCalc. So it will always  
appear in the output.  

You can do something like  

LC[][p1, p2, p3, p4]  
Uncontract[%, p1, p2, p3, p4]  

but I do not see much point in this.
