I don't think that FeynCalc is the right tool for that, unless  
you exactly know what you are doing and how you want to use it.  

There are more automatic frameworks for such studies, i.e.  
FormCalc, GoSam or MadGraph, which already contain codes for  
deriving Feynman diagrams and doing the numerics. So I would look  
into that direction.  

Cheers,
