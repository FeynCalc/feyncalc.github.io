Hello,  

I have defined some Tensors L\_{mu nu} and W^{mu nu} for example like  

Lmunu = FV[l, \\[Rho]]\*FV[k, \\[Sigma]]
+ FV[l, \\[Sigma]]\*FV[k, \\[Rho]]  
Wmunu = FV[pa, \\[Mu]]\*FV[pa, \\[Nu]]  

To get the cross section I used Contract[Lmunu\*Wmunu] which
worked fine. The result now includes some scalar products like pa\*k.
Now I would like to replace this scalar products by some number. How do
I do that? I tried to define e.g.  
SP[pa,k]=1  
before the Contract[...], but this did not work. Did I forget
anything, or is there any other way?  

Thank you, Simone
