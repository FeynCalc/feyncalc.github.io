It is known in Mathematica, for three expressions "1", "r", and "z", the
ordering strategy is  
Input: Ordering[{1, r, z}]  
Output: {1, 2, 3}  

Before I load the FC9.0, The output is what I want:  
Input: 1+r-z//Simplify  
Output: 1+r-z  

After loading the FC9.0  
Input: 1+r-z//Simplify  
Output: r-z+1  

My question is:  
How can I return the default output "1+r-z" when I work with FC?  

Thanks a lot\!
