Is it possible, within FeynCalc, to work with expressions containing  
structure constants from SU(N) groups with different values of N ?  

For example, contractions of objects with SU(N) indices already yield  
answers which depend on N in the desired way, such as:  

        SUNSimplify[SUNF[a,b,c]
SUNF[a,b,d],SUNNToCACF -\> False]  

which evaluates to  

        N \\delta\_{c d}  

as expected.  

If however, I were to have a more complicated product of four  
structure constants; two from SU(N) (contracted together) and two  
from SU(M) (contracted together); then I would like to be able to  
simplify the whole expression and obtain an answer like  

        N M \\delta\_{c d} \\delta\_{g h}.  

Is it possible to attach particular dimensions M and N to different  
structure constants?  

Many thanks,  

Christopher  

P.S. I snooped around in the code FeynCalc.m a bit to see if I  
could spot a solution in there, and I wondered if SUNF2[...]
(as  
opposed to SUNF[...]) might help me out, however
SUNSimplify[...]  
does not seem to simplify expressions composed of SUN2[...]
objects,  
so I guess I should leave them well alone ...
