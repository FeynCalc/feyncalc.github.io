Hello again and thanks for your fast answer\!  

I updated FeynCalc as suggested and the first problem is solved. As you
said, is working fine :D  

Concerning the second part, I have some "minimal" working example that I
could send to you to show the sign thing. Let me now, if you are
interested, how I could send this to you (I am new to the forums and I
don't know which option would be better).  

I was having a look at your implementation of Eq.(4.54) from the paper
you mention: I am not sure that I fully understand the algorithm as
implemented in the "NPointTo4Point.m" file you mention, but, could it be
that there is possibly a minus sign missing?  
*\>From the paper I understand:*  

  E0\*Det[Y\_{ij}] + D0(0)Det[Y\_{ij}(/0)] + ... +
D0(4)Det[Y\_{ij}(/4)] = 0 +  

in which Y\_{ij}(/n) is the Y\_{ij} with the n-th row replaced by 1's,
whereby  

  E0\*Det[Y\_{ij}] = - ( D0(0)Det[Y\_{ij}(/0)] + ... +
D0(4)Det[Y\_{ij}(/4)] ).  

(actually, implementing myself the previous Eqn. I can reproduce the
"correct" sign) Is it the above "-" sign accounted for in
getDet[] (line 70 in NPointTo4Point.m) ?  

Thanks,  
Pablo
