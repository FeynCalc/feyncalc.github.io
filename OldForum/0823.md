Hi Ralph,  

FeynArts and FeynCalc are two different projects developed by
different  
people, so there is no 100% comptability between the two. For
practical  
purposes one always needs to convert the FeynArts output into
something  
FeynCalc can work with.  

Have a look at the examples, for more details  

https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/tree/master/FeynCalc/fcexamples/QED  

Since you are using FeynCalc 8.2, you don't need to apply to  
FCPrepareFAAmp and specify Transversality-\>True in
PolarizationVector.  
Those are things that came with FeynCalc 9 that is still under
devlopment.  

Also, have a look at the corresponding wiki page:  

https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/wiki/FeynArts\#fatofc  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav

Is it possible for FC to process the output of FA so that traces are
contracted etc? I tried the following:*

something else I should do, or is it not possible to convert the
CreateFeynAmp output into the type of analytical expression you can
usually get in FC?*
