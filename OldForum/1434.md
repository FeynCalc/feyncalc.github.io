I´m trying to calculate the matrix element for a ff-\>ff mediated by a
scalar field. The matrix looks like:  

Ma = 1/(SP[k1 - p1] - m^2) Spinor[k1,
m1].Spinor[-p1, m1].Spinor[-p2, m].Spinor[k2,
m]  

But when I request the contract as,  

Ma2 = FermionSpinSum[Ma\*MaC] // Contract  

it does not work, saying "DiracSimplify::spinorsleft: Error\! After
applying FermionSpinSum to all spinor chains the output  
still contains spinors. Evaluation aborted."  

What I´m doing wrong? Thanks in advance\!
