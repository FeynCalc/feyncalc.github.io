Hi,  
  I find there is a bug in Contract Command. I runs the following code
in version 8.1.0, and it seems also exit in FeynCalc 8.2.0  

In[26]:= Contract[(FV[p1, mu2] - FV[pJ,
mu2])\*FV[k2, mu1]\*FV[pJ, af]]  

Out[26]= Contract(p1^mu2-pJ^mu2,pJ^af
k2^mu1,Contract3-\>False).  

Is it possible to remove the Contract3-\>False?  

Cheers  

Mcqueen
