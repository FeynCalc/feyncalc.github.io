I am running FeynCalc 4.1.1 on Mathematica 7.01 (Unix machine).  

The command DiracTrick[] doesn't work at all. If I try to
evaluate trace, the DiracTrick comes back in the output. I've tried the
examples in the Help, and non of them work.  

I've figured out how to solve this: using Calc. For example:  

Tr[ ... //Calc]  

does the job. But sometimes it is really inconvenient putting Calc
everywhere. Do you have any idea what problem am I facing?  

Thank you in advance,  

Luka
