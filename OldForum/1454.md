eh, what you mean is that i should replace it by myself for SU(2), just
as  
In[3]:= SUNF[a, b, c] SUNF[a, d, e] /.  
 SUNF[a\_, b\_, c\_] SUNF[a\_, d\_, e\_] -\> (SD[b,
d] SD[c, e] -  
    SD[b, e] SD[c, d])  

Out[3]= \\[Delta]^(bd)
\\[Delta]^(ce)-\\[Delta]^(be) \\[Delta]^(cd)  

right?  

and i want to ask another question,  
In[16]:= SD[a, b] SUNTF[{m}, a, c] //
SUNSimplify  
SDF[a, b] SUNTF[{m}, a, c] // SUNSimplify  

Out[16]= \\[Delta]^(ab) Subsuperscript[T, ac,
m]  

Out[17]= Subsuperscript[T, bc, m]  

\\delta^ab(SD[a,b]) couldn't combine with SUNTF, and
\\delta\_ab(SDF[a,b]) could do it. but the indices of \\delta
came from \\epsilon is over up, and if i want to combine the
two(namely,\\epsilon and T^m\_ab), should i replace the head of SD to
SDF in the intermediate process?  
Thanks a ton
