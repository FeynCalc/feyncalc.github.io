Hi Jongping,  

*\>\> (Since your computer does not have these problem, I would like to
ask*  
*\>\> you again to obtain the relation between E0 and B0 for me to check
my*  
*\>\> result. Thank you.)*  

Sure:  

PaVe[0, {0, 0, SPD[p, p], 0, SPD[p, p], 0,
SPD[p, p], SPD[p, p],  
    SPD[p, p], SPD[p, p]}, {0, 0, 0, 0,  
    0}] == -(((-8 + D) (-5 + D) (-3 + D) B0[SPD[p, p],
0, 0])/(  
   2 SPD[p, p]^3))  

I think that I also understand where your problems come from. In all
the  
notebooks you sent me I see the  

FeynCalc is already loaded\! To reload it, please restart the kernel.  
$Aborted  

message at the very beginning. This means that you tried to evaluate  
those notebooks from a Mathematica session that already had FeynCalc
loaded.  

This is a problem, because add-ons like FeynHelpers can be activated  
only when FeynCalc is loaded for the first time, but not at a later
stage.  

So if you have a notebook open, where FeynCalc was loaded alone,  
like  

\<\<FeynCalc\`  

and then you try to evaluate a notebook that begins with  

$LoadAddOns={"FeynHelpers"};  
\<\<FeynCalc\`  

then you will receive the "FeynCalc is already loaded\!"-message and  
FeynHelpers will not be loaded, so that you cannot FIREBurn and
PaXEvaluate.  

Hence, you should either open those notebooks in a new Mathematica  
session, or restart the kernel via Evaluation -\> Quit kernel -\>
Local  
beforehand. Please make sure instead of  

"FeynCalc is already loaded\!" you see something like  

Loading FeynCalc from /home/vs/.Mathematica/Applications/FeynCalc/  
$PrePrint is set to FeynCalcForm. Use FI and FC to change the display  
format.  
FeynCalc 9.2.0. For help, use the documentation center, check out the  
wiki or write to the mailing list.  
See also the supplied examples. If you use FeynCalc in your research,  
please cite  
  â€¢ V. Shtabovenko, R. Mertig and F. Orellana, Comput. Phys.
Commun.,  
207C, 432-444, 2016, arXiv:1601.01167  
  â€¢ R. Mertig, M. BÃ¶hm, and A. Denner, Comput. Phys. Commun., 64,  
345-359, 1991.  
FeynHelpers 1.0.0 loaded.  
Have a look at the supplied examples. If you use FeynHelpers in your  
research, please cite  
  â€¢ V. Shtabovenko, "FeynHelpers: Connecting FeynCalc to FIRE and  
Package-X", TUM-EFT 75/15, arXiv:1611.06793  
Furthermore, remember to cite the authors of the tools that you are  
calling from FeynHelpers, which are  
  â€¢ FIRE by A. Smirnov, if you are using the function FIREBurn.  
  â€¢ Package-X by H. Patel, if you are using the function
PaXEvaluate.  

like in all the notebooks that I sent you. This way everything should  
work properly.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
