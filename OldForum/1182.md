Hi,  

you can do something like  

exp = h Exp[I SP[p1, x]] + hdag Exp[I SP[p1,
x]]  
FourDivergence[exp, FV[p1, mu]]  

but in general FeynCalc is not well suited for such  
kind of calculations in the operator formalism.  
There are no distinction between upper and lower indices  
and no simple possibilities to access temporal and spatial  
components of Lorentz tensors.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
