Dear Jorge,  

you are welcome.  

An additional feature of OneLoop not present in TID is the rewriting  
of fermion chains into "standard matrix elements"  
(arXiv:0709.1075, Section 5), i.e. pieces with chiral projectors
GA[6]  
and GA[7].  
It is quite useful for many EW calculations, especially in B physics.  

This is nowadays handled by ToStandardMatrixElement  

https://feyncalc.github.io/FeynCalcBook/ref/ToStandardMatrixElement.html  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
