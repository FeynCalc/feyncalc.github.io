No problem.

On GitHub this indeed works, but this early 00's style mailing list is  
not advanced ;)

Yes. But if you want you can also create an issue on GitHub and attach  
your example there, it really doesn't matter. I just thought that you  
were subscribed to the mailing list, so attaching your example to the  
e-mail would have been the simplest thing to do.  

Cheers,
