Hello and thank you very much for the prompt  
attention to my message.  
 I have replaced the the corrected file and tested it for  
all my previously wrong examples and for examples with up to 5 pairs of
SUNT-s. It works correctly, but it doesn't simplify  
one very important sample:  

In[4]:=  
SUNSimplify[SUNT[a].SUNT[b].SUNT[c].SUNT[a].SUNT[b].SUNT[c]]  
 it just outputs the product T-s. Theanalytic result is  
(-1/2\*(C\_A-1/2\*C\_F))^2\*C\_F+
1.2\*C\_A\*(-1/2\*(C\_A-1/2\*C\_F))\*C\_F=  
(N^2+1)\*(N^2-1)/(2N)^3.  

 I was wondering if there is a fix for this problem, since if  
one wants to make calculations with large number of T-s which  
are undoable by hand, then FeynCalc is the only way to go.  

Best Regards:
