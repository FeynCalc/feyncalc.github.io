Hallo,  

What is the meaning of FinalSubstitution option in OneLoop? I didn't
find any  
explanation in the documentation. Can somebody give me an example?  

I did some loop calculations with FeynCalc and now I would like to
assign some  
values to the Passarino-Veltman integrals within some substraction
scheme  
( A0(M2)=0, A0(m)=m^2\*ln(m^2/M^2) etc.) and play a little bit with
the  
masses and another parameters. How can I achieve this? Is the
mentioned  
option the right way for me?  

Alexander.
