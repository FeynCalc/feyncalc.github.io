*\>Thank you for the suggestions. I will look more closely at FORM.*  
   
*\>Actually I had two things in mind when I considered MathCode to
\>generate stand-alone C++ code from Mathematica. I ran FeynCalc on a
\>farm of 300 machines to successfully calculate Dirac amplitudes for
\>some 40,000 diagrams and have publishable results, but the number of
\>processes I could have going was limited by the number of licenses
\>for Mathematica (could run only about 20 kernels at a time). So with
\>stand-alone code the number of the processes can go up an order of
\>magnitude, allowing to go to the next order of the calculation.
\>Secondly, it might still be faster to run a binary file rather than
\>a Mathematica notebook (no I/O delay, etc).*  

You do not need to use a Mathematica notebook to run FeynCalc code.  
You can find some old ASCII-only examples in the original FeynCalc Guide
(get all FCGuide\*.ps.gz files) at  
<http://www.feyncalc.org/oldfc/>  
   
*\>FORM seems to be useful for the grid-computing as well, but I
simply*  
*\>prefer to work with Mathematica and C++ (easier to develop complex
\>code) if it will be reasonable to do.*  

What you want is not possible at all.  
   
*\>P.S. I am thinking to try and get a trial version of MathCode to
\>test it when I will have some free time (a good while later).*  
MathCode will not do what you want.  
It is easy to find in :
