Hi,  

I never needed this myself, but I guess there is no point why it
should  
not be available.  

So I improved MomentumCombine to handle Eps tensors as well, such that  

MomentumCombine[LC[][a, b, c, p] +
LC[][a, b, c, q]] // FCE  

gives  

LC[][a, b, c, p + q]  

One can also disable this via the LC-\>False option. Then  

MomentumCombine[LC[][a, b, c, p] +
LC[][a, b, c, q],LC-\>False]  

returns  

LC[][a, b, c, p] + LC[][a, b, c, q]  

It is already the development branch of FeynCalc 9.3 that I hope to  
release soon. You can test it via  

Import["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/master/install.m"]  
InstallFeynCalc[InstallFeynCalcDevelopmentVersion -\> True]  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
