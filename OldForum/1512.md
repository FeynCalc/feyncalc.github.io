Hi,  

to reproduce a problem I always need a minimal working example,  
otherwise there is no way to guess what is going wrong.  

But apart from that, I don' think that using FeynHelpers for something  
beyond 1-loop is a good idea. This is simply not the way how these  
calculations are usually done. The Mathematica version of FIRE is
anyhow  
too slow for anything useful nowadays, even at 2-loops. And since you  
don't have a proper identification of the loop integrals into  
topologies, It will be very inconvenient to calculate the masters,
even  
if you somehow get through the IBP stage.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
