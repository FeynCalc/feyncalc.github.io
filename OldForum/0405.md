Hello\~  

Recently I became to use FeynCalc.  
It looks great \! I am studying to use this package. But nowaday  
it seems that I can not understand well the usage of multiplication  
operator, for example, the usage of '.' .  

In HTLM document in this webpage, dot '.' means non-commutive  
operator product. LC symbol is commutive stuff. So we can treat LC  
as scalar. But when we put it into trace, it seems that there is some  
problem.  

Please, see my problem as following.  
What is right? And why ohter are wrong (Why they are different) ?  

1  
FV[p, \\mu]\*LC[\\mu,\\nu,\\alpha,\\beta]\*  
(  
  (GA[k\_1]\_ i a5).GA[\\nu].(GS[k\_2]+i
a1).gamma.(GS[p]-GS[k\_1+i a3]).GA[5]  
) //  
Tr //  
Contract  

2  
FV[p, \\mu]\*  
(  
  (GA[k\_1]\_ i
a5).LC[\\mu,\\nu,\\alpha,\\beta]\*GA[\\nu].(GS[k\_2]+i
a1).gamma.(GS[p]-GS[k\_1+i a3]).GA[5]  
) //  
Tr //  
Contract  

3  
FV[p, \\mu]\*  
(  
  (GA[k\_1]\_ i
a5)\*LC[\\mu,\\nu,\\alpha,\\beta]\*GA[\\nu].(GS[k\_2]+i
a1).gamma.(GS[p]-GS[k\_1+i a3]).GA[5]  
) //  
Tr //  
Contract  

\-------------  
i : imaginary number  
a1,a3,a5 : constant  
gamma : second rank tensor which I difined. It has no problem.  

thanks  

regards  
huiyoung
