Hi there,  

I've just began a project, going to calculate the decay rate of a new
effective BSM new lagrangian. Can we implement this new lagrangian to
FeynCalc and calculate the decay rate?  
beside the manual, I took a look at some other materials on the web and
I didn't found something to help me.  

Best,  
A.B.
