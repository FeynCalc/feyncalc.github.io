Hi Rolf,  

*\>It will probably not show up once you do more complicated

Actually, the code was a part of a much more complicated expression
where the problem with Contract was found. I've just reduced the
integral to a small piece where the problem already shows up.  
But anyway, thank you a lot for providing the patch. It helps.  

Alexander Semke.
