Hello,  
 I am using fc5beta2 with Mathematica 5.2 both on MacOsX 10.4. There is
a small but very frustrating problem when one runs
Tr[0.\*GS[p]]  
\--------------  

In[1]:=  
\<\<HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`  

In[2]:=  
Tr[DiracSimplify[0.\*GS[p]]]  

*\>From In[2]:=*  
\\\!\\(\\\*FormBox[  
  RowBox[{\\(Power::"infy"\\), \\(\\(:\\)\\(\\ \\)\\),
"\\\<\\"Infinite expression \\\\\!\\\\(  
      TraditionalForm\\\\\`1\\\\/0.\`\\\\)  
    encountered.
\\\\\!\\\\(\\\\\*ButtonBox[\\\\\\"More&\#8230;\\\\\\", \\  
ButtonStyle-\>\\\\\\"RefGuideLinkText\\\\\\", ButtonFrame-\>None, \\  
ButtonData:\>\\\\\\"Power::infy\\\\\\"]\\\\)\\"\\\>"}],
TraditionalForm]\\)  

*\>From In[2]:=*  
\\\!\\(\\\*FormBox[  
  RowBox[{\\(&\#8734;::"indet"\\), \\(\\(:\\)\\(\\ \\)\\),
"\\\<\\"Indeterminate  
      expression \\\\\!\\\\n\\\\(  
      TraditionalForm\\\\\`\\\\(0.\`\\\\\\\\ \\  
\\\\(\\\\(\\\\(\\\\(TraditionalForm\\\\\`\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\[Gamma]\\\\\\"\\\\)\\\\)
&\#183; \\  
\\\\(\\\\(TraditionalForm\\\\\`p\\\\)\\\\)\\\\)\\\\)\\\\\\\\
ComplexInfinity\\\\)\\\\)\\\\n \\  
encountered. \\\\\!\\\\(\\\\\*ButtonBox[\\\\\\"More&\#8230;\\\\\\",
\\  
ButtonStyle-\>\\\\\\"RefGuideLinkText\\\\\\", ButtonFrame-\>None, \\  
ButtonData:\>\\\\\\"General::indet\\\\\\"]\\\\)\\"\\\>"}],
TraditionalForm]\\)  

Out[2]=  
Indeterminate  
\----------------------------------  

The exchange to tr = TR[Calc[\#]]&; doesn't help.
Expressions multiplied by "real" 0 occur in processing large expressions
involving lots of terms, so it would be extremely hard to hunt all
instances of 0. which occur as cancellations of terms with "real"
coefficients like 0.5\*GS[p]-0.5\*GS[p]. Is there an
easy way to get rid of this annoying error and get the correct answer
for Tr[0.]=0?  

 One more question, why Tr[0] doesn't return 0?  

```
