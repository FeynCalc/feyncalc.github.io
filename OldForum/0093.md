OK, so I've updated the CVS repository and the development version  
at  

<http://www.feyncalc.org/download/HighEnergyPhysics.tar.gz>  

The same remarks apply as the ones on  

<[0093.html](0093.html)>  

Moreover:  

The contraction should be done correctly now. Sorry for the
inconvenience,  
but making FeynCalc completely compatible with FeynArts I think is of
some  
importance. If you don't need this, just keep using the version of
FeynCalc  
you have.  

The development version might still need some work in this respect and
I  
would be happy for any feedback.
