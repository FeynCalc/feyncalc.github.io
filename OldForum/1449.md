Hello and congratulations for the program and its maintenance,  

For some reasons, in my calculations it is way easier to keep the LC
tensors uncontracted up to the very end, so I prefer using
simplifications via EpsEvaluate[] and
Contract[,Rename-\>True,EpsContract-\>False].  
I found however that the following input  
Â   
EpsEvaluate[LC[a, b][p, q] LC[a][r, s,
t] LC[b][r, s, t]]  

does not produce a vanishing result (but same output as input) despite
this should be obvious from antisymmetry reasons. When using  

Contract[LC[a, b][p, q] LC[a][r, s,
t] LC[b][r, s, t]]  

of course leads to 0, but then it would contract other LC tensors in my
expression, that I prefer to avoid.  

Since the reasons for which is zero is only antisymmetry, I was
wondering if this could be easily implemented into my expressions.  

Best regards,  
Pablo
