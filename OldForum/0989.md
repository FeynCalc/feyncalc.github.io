Hi Xing,  

this is expected, because setting $LimitTo4 = False is used to prevent  
the reduction.  

With the default value of $LimitTo4 you get fully correct reduction for
B1  

SetOptions[B0, BReduce -\> True]  
B1[pp, m1^2, m2^2] // Simplify  

\-((-A0[m1^2] + A0[m2^2] + (m1^2 - m2^2 + pp) B0[pp,
m1^2, m2^2])/(  
Â 2 pp))  

which agrees with the literature (Eq. B.6 in arXiv:hep-ph/0212259v2)  
Likewise for B11  

SetOptions[B0, BReduce -\> True]  
B11[pp, m1^2, m2^2] // Simplify  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
