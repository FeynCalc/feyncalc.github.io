Please be nice and supply actual examples which you think give a wrong
result.  

Also, feel free to write a new version of FeynCalc.  
Or use FORM or Color (
<http://www.nikhef.nl/~form/maindir/packages/color/color.html> ) or
whatever program is used these days.  

Frederik and me are just supporting FeynCalc a bit in our scarce  
free time.  
We both are not doing active research for years by now and  
we are not paid to help you or to improve or even supply FeynCalc.  
We just keep this website and the code in the public domain as long as
people want to use it and as long as we like it.  

Thank you,  

Rolf
