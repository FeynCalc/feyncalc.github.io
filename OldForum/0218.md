Hello,

This is the path followed by the FOC project  
(<http://www-calfor.lip6.fr/foc/index-en.html>). The objective is to
make  
a provable CAS. They are using free software for that (the OCaml  
language and the Coq proof assistant) but unfortunalty, they have
chosen  
to make the system closed source and proprietary[1].  

On the Axiom side, there is a path that can be followed: using ACL2  
(<http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/>) to make a similar  
system. Both Axiom and ACL2 (and Maxima) run on GCL. But all the hard  
work (i.e. proving things) remain to be done.

code,*  
*\> which at the and was relatively complex.*  

Interesting idea: systematizing the idea of reference  
implementation. And formal proofs between the different
implementations  
are not necessary. We just need a framework to easily redo a fast  
computation with a slower but safer implementation. Of course, formal  
proof would be a plus, but I doubt that it can be done.  

Yours,  
david  

[1] I wonder when one french reasearcher will understand the
power and  
    necessity of free software for real research\!
