Hello forum,  

I encountered some problems when contracting Lorentz indeces while
having Dirac matrices and spinors in my amplitudes. Here is my
program:  

Tau1[p\_, q\_, m\_, a\_, b\_] :=
-I\*kappa/2\*(1/4\*(GA[a]\*(FV[p, b] + FV[q, b])
+ GA[b]\*(FV[p, a] + FV[q, a])) -
1/2\*MT[a,b] \*(1/2\*(DiracSlash[p] +
DiracSlash[q]) - m));  
P[a\_, b\_, c\_, d\_] := 1/2\*(MT[a, c]MT[b, d]
+ MT[a, d]MT[b, c] - MT[a, b]MT[c,
d]);  
iDF[q\_, a\_, b\_, c\_, d\_] := I\*P[a, b, c, d] /
(ScalarProduct[q,q] + ieps);  
M = -I\*SpinorUBar[p - q, m1].Tau1[p, p - q, m1, a, b] .
SpinorU[p, m1] \* iDF[q, a, b, c, d] \*
SpinorUBar[p+q,m2] . Tau1[p, p + q, m2, c, d] .
SpinorU[p, m2]  

If I now enter Contract[M], some Lorentz indeces are not
contracted. If I enter Calc[M] or DiracSimplify[M],
Mathematica gives strange results involving gamma matrices with index
$MU(1).  

Does anyone know why this problem shows up and how I can get around
it???  

Thank you very much,  

Andreas Ross
