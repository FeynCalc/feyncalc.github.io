Dear FeynCalc users,  

I'm very happy to announce that a new FeynCalc add-on called
"FeynOnium"  
is now official. Its main goal is to facilitate matching calculations
in  
nonrelativistic effective field theories (NREFTs). At the same time,  
with the  
release of FeynOnium we now officially support nonrelativistic
calculations  
using FeynCalc.  

The accompanying preprint that also serves as a manual is available
here:  

https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15451  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
