A long time ago, when I wrote my sub-package PHI I tried to fill this
exact gap by providing some simple examples both from chiral
perturbation theory (which PHI was written for originally), but also
from QED. You can find them by clicking on the "PHI" link on the front
page and then looking in the "Examples" directory. There's som html at
e.g.  

<http://www.feyncalc.org/phi/examplesHTML/QED/QEDRadiativeCorrections/>  

The idea of PHI was to allow a lagrangian as starting point and then
have FeynCalc/PHI generate the necessary Feynman rules for FeynArts
automatically.  

Of course this was done so long ago that I doubt it'll work with the
current version of FeynArts. It should be pretty straight forward to fix
though - for anyone interested enough :-)  

Cheers,  
Frederik
