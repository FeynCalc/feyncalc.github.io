Hi Will,  

the change was actually introduce by an update in FeynArts from March
2019  

https://github.com/FeynCalc/feynarts-mirror/commit/73094019d93c8a11cf8eee7189e5514a8e9154d6\#diff-cc9305310a3b0771b5c2045c39d7cc73R491  

so that since then FeynArts joins propagators raised to integers  
together, according to  

PropagatorDenominator[p\_, m\_, d\_\_\_]^n\_. ^:=  
   PropagatorDenominator[p, m, d + n]  

Nevertheless, I've just added a new option FeynAmpDenominatorCombine
to  
FCFAConvert, that should be able to emulate the old behavior. When set  
to False, FCFAConvert will return the relevant propagators as e.g.  
FAD[p1+p2] ^2 instead of FAD[p1+p4,p1+p4].  

I'm not sure that it will give you exactly the same results as before  
the change  
in FA, but perhaps it still helps to preserve your workflow.  

Otherwise, applying FeynAmpDenominatorSplit directly might also be an  
option.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
