uups, something did not work with the mail gateway in my previous
answer: here the rest:  
\-----  

Maybe this should all be rewritten ( ... and if you write a proposal for
the European Commission or Mr. Soros or CERN or whomever  
and get money I'll do it or supervise it ).  

Anyway, here is one way to get what you want:  
trn = Function[x,  
   Calc[Explicit[x]] /. (a:SUNT[\_]..) .  
      (b\_ /; FreeQ[b,  
        SUNT]) :\> Dot[a]\*TR[b]]  

Then  
trn[QGV[mu, a].QGV[nu, b]]  
will work.
