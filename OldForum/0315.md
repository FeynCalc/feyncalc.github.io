Hi Rolf,  

Thank you very much for suggestions. I have already implemented some of
them.  

About onshell conditions: does using mt2 instead of mt^2 make a
difference regarding to efficiency?  

I am kind of happy with OneLoop and whenever I try OneLoopSimplify or
OneLoop with such setting, the CPU time becomes unacceptably large(for
C-type, order of day) for especially C and D type diagrams. Of course if
one is patient enough, then a lot simplified output is obtained. So I
have to prefer using OneLoop and then try to make the simplifications
after that. That's the way I found as a solution to the performance
problem.  

Swiching to FormCalc: it seems that it is faster but so far I haven't
manage to compile it or get the compiled version of it for windows
platform.  

Thanks again for your support,  

Best regards,  
Ismail
