Hmm, somehow I don't see any attachment. Just for reference,  
this is how posts with attachments look like on the mailing list  
(scroll to the very end)  

\<<[1170.html](1170.html)>\>

Not sure that I got the thing with "drag and drop" right. If you are  
subscribed to the mailing list the usual way  

[QUOTE]  
Subscribe / unsubscribe by sending an email to  
subscribeATfeyncalc.org/unsubscribeATfeyncalc.org (replace "AT" with
"@"):  
Please write a few words about how you intend to use FeynCalc and put  
your email address in the subject line.  
[/QUOTE]  

then you can just attach files as usual using your e-mail program. For  
"anonymous" mails sent via  

\<[feyncalc_at_HIDDEN-E-MAIL](http://www.feyncalc.org/forum/mail.php?TO_EMAIL_ADDR=%3CA%20HREF=)"\>http://www.feyncalc.org/forum/mail.php?TO\_EMAIL\_ADDR=[feyncalc_at_HIDDEN-E-MAIL]\>  

no attachments are possible (at least to my knowledge). So, which way  
did you use?  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav  

*\> I have compared plain LoopTools E0 result (note this meanse that
this must be done then for particular numerics or phase space point) and
the 5 to 4 point reduction implemented in FeynCalc. In addition, I
attached the necessary Y\_{ij} matrix appearing in the code in case this
could help.*
