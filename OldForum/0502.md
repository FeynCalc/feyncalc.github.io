I think there is a software that can do what you want. Please look up
the third party softwares in the Mathematica web site.

Subject: FORTRAN 77/90 to Mathematica  

Hi,  

I just wanted to know that is there any way out to convert Fortran77 or
Fortran90 files into Mathematica? I am infact working with HELAS and
want to transform my output into FeynCalc.  

Anyone please help.
