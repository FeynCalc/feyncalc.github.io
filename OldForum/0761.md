Dear Colleague,  

My computer is MacBook Pro, and the system is MacOsX 10.8.5.  
Mathematica version is 9.  
In a Mathematica notebook, when I wrote  

$LoadPhi = True;  
$LoadFeynArts = True;  
<<HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`  

and run them, I face with this warning  

$LoadPhi = True;  
True  

$LoadFeynArts = True;  
True  

<<HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`  
Loading FeynCalc from  
/Users/Roman/Library/Mathematica/Applications/HighEnergyPhysics  
FeynCalc 8.2.0 For help, type ?FeynCalc, open FeynCalcRef8.nb or visit  
www.feyncalc.org  
Loading PHI  
WARNING\! Your FeynArts installation is not complete or the version
you  
have cannot be used with this version of FeynCalc.  
FeynArts can be downloaded at www.feynarts.de  
Loading FeynArts, see www.feynarts.de for documentation  
FeynArts not found. Please install FeynArts, e.g., in  
/Users/Roman/Library/Mathematica  
and reload FeynCalc  
FeynArts can be downloaded from www.feynarts.de  

I tried to solve this problem using the recommendation above "Please  
install FeynArts, e.g., in  
/Users/Roman/Library/Mathematica  
and reload FeynCalc" but it doesn't work. And to avoid some  
incompatibility between versions, I also tried it with different
versions,  
I can say with all combinations of them. The warning is the same.  
Could you please help to solve this problem, or at least some idea?  

Sincerely
