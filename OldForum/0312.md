The FeynCalc Manual has the following note about the OneLoop function:  

NOTICE: While OneLoop is restricted to 't Hooft Feynman....  

In what sense ithe OneLoop resticted to the t'Hooft gauge \_GaugeXi-\>1?
Does it also work in the physical gauge \_GaugeXi-\>0? Could you give an
example in general gauge that OneLoop cannot handle?  

Many thanks  
Jon Palmer
