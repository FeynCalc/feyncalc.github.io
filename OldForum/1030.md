Hello,  

I currently need FeynCalc in order to evaluate a number of traces.  

Whenever I try to evaluate them, there is always a bunch of
Eps[p1,p2,p3,p4] around that I know to vanish analytically, (but
as there are hundreds of terms, cannot convince myself of just to
ignore).  

When I run this on a Mac with Mathematica v. 10.0.2 they vanish
explicitly. When I run exactly the same notebook on a Windows machine
with Mathematics 10.2.0 they appear.  

Any clues on 1) what is happening and 2) whether I can helt FeynCalc
reduces all these?  

Best, Mikkel
