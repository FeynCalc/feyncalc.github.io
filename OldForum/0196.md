Greetings, and thanks for your interest in this project\!  

In general, we are still assessing the best way to proceed, and are  
hoping to get a response from the feyncalc developers on their  
opinions. The topic has been raised in both maxima and axiom groups,  
in both of which there is considerable interest to proceed. There is a  
tool called mockmma which supplies a mathematica-like interface in  
lisp, and a parser which is most likely the easiest way to get  
started. I've successfully compiled it in ansi gcl, but haven't yet  
had time for much more.  

Take care,  

"Siver Andrey"
