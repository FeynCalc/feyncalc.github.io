Hi,  

we experienced some problems with the Levi-Civita tensor in the latest
version (5 beta1) of FeynCalc which didn't exist in version 4.1.1  
If I enter for example  

Contract[Eps[LorentzIndex[a], LorentzIndex[b],
LorentzIndex[c], LorentzIndex[d]]\*FV[p,
a]\*FV[p + q, b]]  

that works in the old version and it throws away the part where p is
contracted with two indeces of the Eps tensor.  
In the new version however it does not do that. Is there any quick fix
for it or can I first use something like  
ScalarProductExpand before contracting?  

Besides, I found that ScalarProductExpand[FV[p + q, a]]
gives different results in version 5 beta1, it does not add the Lorentz
index a to both parts as it used to do in version 4.1.1  

Unfortunately we need the features of 5 beta1 for our current programs,
so is there any way to make FeynCalc 5 beta1 contract the epsilon
tensors correctly?  

Thank you very much for your help\!\!\!  

Andreas
