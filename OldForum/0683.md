There is a new version FeynCalc 8.1.0 for Mathematica 8  
available from <http://www.feyncalc.org/download>  
which has some small fixes (improved SUNSimplify,  
fixed DiracEquation, DiracTrick working again, Tarcer .mx loading
automatically under Linux and Windows, fixed Hyperlinks in
Documentation/FeynCalcRef8.nb, rerun examples in fcexamples).  

I did not test this version on Mathematica 7, but I think it should just
work.  

Enjoy and let the mailing list know if you find any problems.  

Rolf
