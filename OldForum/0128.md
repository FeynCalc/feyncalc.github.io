Sorry for the typo. Should have been  

amp = Pair[Momentum[k], Momentum[p1]]^3
FeynAmpDenominator[  
        PropagatorDenominator[k, lam],
PropagatorDenominator[(k - q), lam],  
        PropagatorDenominator[(k - p1), m],
PropagatorDenominator[(k +  
p2), M]];  

and yes, there does seem to be a problem. I will investigate it.
