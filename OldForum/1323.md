(edit: sending this again as forgot to include email address in subject
line)  
I'd like to use the PaVeReduce function within FeynCalc in Mathematica  
 to reduce a triangle integral down to bubbles and tadpoles. I found
the  
wolfram help page about this function but I did not find what all the
options  
 meant with the result that I was unable to produce the reduction I
wanted.  

I have used other software for this reduction and I know what the answer
is  
so I'm just playing about with FeynCalc at the moment. I tried  

     PaVeReduce[C0[0, m^2, m^2/y, 0, 0, m^2]] //
TraditionalForm  

but this didn't do the required reduction. I played about with the
options too in  

     SetOptions[PaVeReduce, A0ToB0 -\> True, BReduce -\> True,
Collecting -\> True, Dimension -\> True, FCVerbose -\> False, Factoring
-\> Factor2, IsolateNames -\> False, Mandelstam -\> {}, PaVeAutoReduce
-\> True, PaVeOrderList -\> {}, WriteOutPaVe -\> True]  

but couldn't get the reduction to go ahead.  

Thanks for any comments\! There is also the possibility that I am using
the wrong  
 function because I know that Pass-Velt prescription is usually done for
the reduction  
of tensor to scalar integrals and I'm trying to do a scalar to sum of
simpler scalar  
integrals reduction.
