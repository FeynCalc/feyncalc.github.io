Hi\!  

When I use DiracReduce I do find different results in the end depending
on the order I use DiracReduce on substructures of the whole expression.
Looks like this (of course normally bigger structures):  

T1 = (-MT[a, b] + GA[a, b]).(-MT[c, d] +
GA[c, d])  
T2 = (-MT[a, b] + GA[a, b]);  
T3 = (-MT[c, d] + GA[c, d]);  
DR1 = DiracReduce[T1]  
DR2 =
DiracReduce[DiracReduce[T2].DiracReduce[T3]]  
DR3 =
DiracReduce[Calc[DiracReduce[T2].DiracReduce[T3]]]  
DIFF1 = Calc[DR2 - DR3]  
DIFF2 = Calc[DR1 - DR3]  

DIFF2 is 0. DIFF1 not. (Introducing Calc in DR3 to make DIFF2 zero does
not work generally)  
Am I doing something wrong?  

Thanks very much for all your work.  
Regards  
Michael
