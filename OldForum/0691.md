Hello,  

is there a way to use in Mathematica/Feyncalc (as a simplification rule)
the Schouten identity? It can be written in several different forms, for
example (schematically)  

MT[f,a] Eps[b,c,d,e] + MT[f,b]
Eps[c,d,e,a] + MT[f,c] Eps[d,e,a,b] +
MT[f,d] Eps[e,a,b,c] +MT[f,e]
Eps[a,b,c,d] = 0  

which holds in four dimensions simply because the left hand side is
fully antisymmetric in the five indices a,b,c,d,e. An analogous identity
holds in other dimensions as well. In general the indices can be dotted
to other vectors or tensors, so one needs to Uncontract all indices as a
first step. This identity seems to be included in FORM, but I have not
found it in Mathematica/Feyncalc. I would greatly appreciate any hint at
how it could be implemented\!  

Thanks\!  
Tomas
