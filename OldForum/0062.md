  Dear Developers,  
Sorry for disturbing you.  
I looked other mail in the forum, but didn't find answer to my
problem.  
It's Ok with finding the proper files, but some strange errors occure:  
 In[3]:=  
<<HighEnergyPhysics\`fc\`  
*\>From In[3]:=*

  RowBox[{\\(DeclarePackage::"cxt"\\), \\(\\(:\\)\\(\\ \\)\\),
