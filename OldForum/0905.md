I am a little bit confused with the results I get using PaVeReduce.
Naimely, one should expect the Passarino-Veltman function C\_{12} to be
symmetric with respect to the replacement p1 \<-\> p2 and m1 \<-\> m2,
according to its definition.  

However, I don't get this result when evaluating it with PaVeReduce:  

PaVe[1, 2, {p10, p12, p20}, {m02, m12, m22}] -  
  PaVe[1, 2, {p20, p12, p10}, {m02, m22, m12}] // PaVeReduce  

The result of the above line is given by B0 functions and it does not
equals zero, even when B0 is exactly calculated and inserted in the
result.  

Can you please tell me if I am doing something wrong? Thank you.  

With regards,
