Dear group,  
I am planning to organize and host the First  
FeynCalc summer school in Berlin, Germany, this summer.  
Please send Email with your wish-list of date (ranges) and  
topics to cover, to (the value of):  

FromCharacterCode[{114,111,108,102,109,64,103,108,117,111,  
110,118,105,115,105,111,110,46,99,111,109}]  

Of course there will be introductory and advanced talks by interested  
participants, but the main character should be to exchange  
knowledge, best practices, and to extend and improve FeynCalc.  

I would also like to touch topics like linking to FeynArts and  
especially FORM.  

If we get enough participants together there will be  
printed (and/or PDF) conference proceedings.  

Best regards from Berlin,
