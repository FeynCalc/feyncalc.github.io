I am using math. 7.0.  
I have properly installed FeynCalc.  

but the problem after loading feyncalc it does not represent  
  B0[p, m1^2, m2^2] in traditional form even after writing  

SetOptions[$FrontEnd,  
 "CommonDefaultFormatTypes" -\> {"Output" -\> TraditionalForm}]  

I have tried from cell menu also; but nothing is going well.  

please help.
