If I contract an eps with a 4 vector as follows:  

Calc[Eps[\\[Alpha], \\[Beta], \\[Gamma],
\\[Delta]].FV[p,\\[alpha]]]  

I get what I would expect:  

p^\\[Alpha] \\[Epsilon]^(\\[Alpha]
\\[Beta] \\[Gamma] \\[Delta])  

But when I do a large calculation with a trace:  

Calc[Tr[GA[5, \\[Alpha], \\[Beta],
\\[Mu], \\[Delta], \\[Nu],
\\[Sigma]]].FV[p, \\[Alpha]]]  

I get something strange, where the p instead of being left as a vector
with an index gets absorbed into the eps:  

\-4 I g^(\\[Beta] \\[Delta])
\\[Epsilon]^(\\[Mu]\\[Nu]\\[Sigma]p) +
other terms  

Which would be fine, except in my actual application I am contracting
two of the same vector with the eps. So when they get raised into the
eps like this the eps obviously vanishes.  

What can I do to stop this?
