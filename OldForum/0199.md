I'm also the lead developer on Magnus, another special-purpose
computer  
algebra system, and I'm having the same struggle. I'm currently
writing  
documentation for the system and need to describe the algorithms, some  
of which have never been written down before. It is a painful process  
to describe an algorithm from computer code, especially when it is  
written by programmers who don't really understand the theory.  

We need to keep the theory and the code together and have each one  
explain the other. How else can you show that the code does what it  
is intended to do?  

That's why I'm interested in the papers behind FeynCalc. If we can  
get it into a literate format the code can be maintained for several  
systems. But if we have to maintain and port code without the  
underlying theory the task is hopeless.
