Another thing about DoPolarizationSums. Let  
bla = LC[a, b, c, d] FV[w, c] PolarizationVector[w,
d] LC[a, b, e, f] FV[w, e]
Conjugate[PolarizationVector[w, f]]  
tmp = Contract[bla]  

Then DoPolarizationSums[bla, w, n] gives  
6w^2 (as I expected)  
but DoPolarizationSums[tmp, w, n] gives  
4w^2 + 2(w^2 - n^2w^2/(nw)^2)  
which is very different answer. For example, for n=w the last answer is
4w^2.
