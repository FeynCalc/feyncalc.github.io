Dear FeynCalc users.  

Due to a misconfiguration in our spam fighting efforts, the mail gateway
has been non-functional for about two weeks. I will now start
recuperating messages posted to the forum in this period.  

The forum works again now, no messages have been lost.  

Many apologies.  

Frederik
