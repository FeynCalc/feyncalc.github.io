Oh, sorry\!, right. Thank you very much.  

So the two problems are solved: I can compute both ampW1 and the  
loop of ampF1.  

But with all these changes, I now face 2 new problems\! The first  
of them shows up when I compute ampW1. Here, I get some objects  
(at least metric tensors and 4-momenta) both with and without  
hat. What do they mean? How I am supposed to deal with them?  

The second problem has to do with the following. As I am working in  
dimensional regularization, I will have to make D -\> 4 - epsilon,  
(and I will want to obtain, on the one hand, the non-divergent term  
coming from the product between epsilon and the PaVe functions, and to  
make, on the other hand, epsilon -\> 0 in the end; by the way, I do  
all of this manually, but maybe there is some automatic function to  
help me with these steps). But as I make D -\> 4 - epsilon, some funny  
objects show up: basically, gamma matrices and 4-momenta with  
subscript "4-epsilon" (or just "epsilon"). I have the same questions:  
what do they mean? How I am supposed to deal with them?  

Thanks again,  
Duarte
