The \*purpose\* of FeynCalc is to be a general purpose framework for
doing  
quantum field theory calculations. That is, dirac matrices, trace  
rules, Feynman rules from Lagrangians, representations for fields and  
the like.  

It also contains code for doing one-loop integrals. This same code  
exists in several places (I know of a fortan library "ff" and a Maple  
package "xloops" as well), and I can point to the papers if people  
desire. But the loop code is only half of FeynCalc.  

The actual algorithms are straightforward, but very tedious to  
calculate, so thus the results are collected into libraries like  
FeynCalc. There are yet a handful of obstacles in dealing with  
divergences that have kept us from writing a fully automatic method of  
computing these loop integrals. At one loop I think it can be fully  
automatic, but I do not think this is something a non-expert would
want  
to tackle.  

The "algorithms" are documented in QFT textbooks such as Peskin &  
Schroeder "An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory", Weinberg "Quantum  
Theory of Fields", etc. This is a one-year graduate level physics  
course. The decomposition of loop integrals into scalar integrals was  
done by Passarino and Veltman  
    <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0550-3213(79>)90234-7  
though these days it's not the only way...  

Cheers,
