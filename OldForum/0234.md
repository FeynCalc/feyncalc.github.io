Dear Authors of the FeynCalc package,  

Probably I've missed something but I wonder is it possible somehow to  
produce a polarization sum from a polarization vector? I found the  
FeynCalc package has the two functions: PolarizationVector and  
PolarizationSum, but I'd like to get PolarizationSum[k,mu,nu]
from  
PolarizationVector[k,mu] and
Conjugate[PolarizationVector[k,nu]].  
Is it feasible?  

Actually I want to calculate an amplitude having a polarization vector
of  
rho-meson. For the test I was trying to calculate the following simple  
amplitude:  

In[1]:= \<\<HighEnergyPhysics\`fc\`  

In[2]:= a =  
Spinor[p4,m4].DiracMatrix[5].Spinor[p2,m2].(Contract[FourVector[2\*p3-2\*p1,mu]  
PolarizationVector[p1,mu]])  
Out[2]= u[p4, m4] . ga[5] . u[p2, m2] .
(2 p3.ep[p1])  

In[3]:= ca=ComplexConjugate[a]  
Out[3]= -2 u[p2, m2] . ga[5] . u[p4, m4]
p3.ep(\*)[p1]  

In[4]:= FermionSpinSum[a ca]  
Out[4]= -2 (tr[(gs[p2] + m2) ga[5]
(gs[p4] + m4) ga[5]] 2  
p3.ep[p1])p3.ep(\*)[p1]  

In[5]:= %/.DiracTrace-\>Tr  
Out[5]= -2 (4 (m2 m4 - p2.p4) 2 p3.ep[p1])
p3.ep(\*)[p1]  

Now I'd like to make a spin sum over the rho-meson spin index but I
did  
not find anything on how to do this by FeynCalc. Of course this is
easyly  
done by "hands" but there may appear more complicated cases. Maybe
there  
exists more elegant way to calculate amplitudes having the
polarization  
vector? If so could you advise me please how to do that?  

Best regards,  
Alexander
