That is a very hard problem in general.  

Good algorithms (as opposed to naïve ones) are often connected to
theory  
in complicated ways -- just look at published algorithms. Then the  
practical implementation of the algorithm is often connected to the  
published algorithm in complicated ways.  

"Literate programming" is effective when the algorithm has a nice  
hierarchical structure, but there are many tricks that good algorithm  
designers and programmers use which don't fit well into that
structure.  
Some years ago, I participated in a conference on transformational  
programming where Tarjan talked about this... it was humbling.  

Personally, I think this is a fascinating area, but it really is a  
research problem in itself. So if your goal is solving physics/math  
problems, I would recommend that you be pragmatic about how far you go  
in trying to systematize the transition from theory to code.
