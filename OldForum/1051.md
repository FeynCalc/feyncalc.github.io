Yes, this is the way it currently works in FC 9.0.x. You need a manual  
replacement, like in  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/blob/hotfix-stable/FeynCalc/Examples/QED/QEDMuonProductionTree.m\>  

In FC 9.1 the SMP-objects with extra typesetting (as mentioned in  
\<<[1044.html](1044.html)>\>  
) will be used instead.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
