Hi,  

I highly suspect that you didn't load the add-on as in  

$LoadAddOns = {"FeynHelpers"};  
<<FeynCalc\`  

PaXEvaluate[B0[SPD[p, p], 0, m^2], PaXSeries -\>
{{pp, m^2, 1}},  
  PaXAnalytic -\> True]  

Otherwise I would need a minimal working example to reproduce the
problem.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
