*\>Are there any differences between 5.1.0beta1 and*  
*\>5.0.0beta1 (which I am using now) ?*  

The stupid trace-bugs are fixed and I also adapted  
FC a bit more for work with Mathematica 5.1.  
Frederik also did do a few things.  
We just have to get around and put things together for  
a release.  

If you want to test the prerelease version let me know (send email
directly to rolf AT mertig.com please ).  

Regards,  

Rolf  

P.s.: The trace-bug-fixes are already in CVS and  
can be viewed and downloaded if you really care.  
However: the bugs are really only happening in special  
simple circumstances and were introduced during the beta phase; they
should not bother people a lot if they use  
Calc[], DiracSimplify, etc. .
