Hello Sir  

I am a physical student , I have a problem with the LeviCivita  

tensor when I try the following commands :  

\===  

Tr[GS[p].GA[mu].GA[nu].GA[rou].GA[5]]  

\===  

and it gave me a result with the letter p in the epsilon's index
position  

Is it a bug ? and How can get the correct form  

Thank You very much
