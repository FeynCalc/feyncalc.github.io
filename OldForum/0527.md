Hello,  
After following the steps given in the installation document; I have
installed Mathematica 5.0 on a Windows system and placed the
HighEnergyPhysics folder in Applications folder: \\Program
Files\\Wolfram Research\\Mathematica\\5.0\\AddOns\\Applications and I’ve
typed \<\<HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\` and it’s work.  
But the problem that I couldn’t install FeynArts\! If you don’t mind,
could you please help me to give me the steps in order to install
FeynArts?  
Best regards.
