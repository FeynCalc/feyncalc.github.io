In FeynCalc, I would like to define a scalar operator as  

Chi: = Integrate[C[p1] (h[p1] e^{-I p1 x} +
h^{dagger}[p1] E^{I p1 x}, d\\vec{p1}  

i.e. the integration is over \\vec{p1} (3-vector).  

p1 and x are four vectors, given by p1 = ( omega[p1, m]\*t,
\\vec{p1}) and x = (t, vec{x}).  

Tried the following  
p1 :=FourVector[ omega[p1,m], m]  
x := FourVector[t,r],  
Then define Chi as in the beginning of this post.  

If I try any calculation like FourDivergence[Chi], it either
returns the input FourDivergence[ full form of \\chi], or just
complains "Recursion limit reached", and then gives some large,
unintelligible output. What am I doing incorrectly? Note that the
&\#967; has been rendered in Mathematica in the above input text, by
"Esc":\\chi":"Esc".
