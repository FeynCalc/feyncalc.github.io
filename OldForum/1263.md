Hi,  

I wanted to expand the following expression in terms of the external
momentum q or (q/mE)  

\-(CA^3\*FAD[{p1, I\*mE}, {p2, I\*mE}, {p1 - q, I\*mE}, {p1 - q,
I\*mE}]\*(FVD[p1, Lor1] + FVD[p1 - q,
Lor1])\*(FVD[p1, Lor2] + FVD[p1 - q,
Lor2])\*(2\*omega[21] - 5\*psi[19])\*SD[a,
b]\*SMP["g\_s"]^6\*(SPD[p2, p2] + SPD[p1 - q, p1
- q]))  

Up to now I have done this as a series by using FourDivergence[]
including first and second order derivatives. Is there a faster way to
do that, as at two loop level this becomes computationally expansive
very rapidly.  

Cheers,  
Philipp
