when i use oneloop to calculate numerator\*FAD[{k, m0},{k - p1, m1},
{k - p2, m2}], PaVe[1,2,{p1^2+p2^2-2 p1
p2,p1^2,p2^2},{m2^2,m1^2, m0^2}] appears. i hope there are just term
like PaVe[1,2,{p1^2, p1^2+p2^2-2 p1 p2,p2^2},{m0^2,m1^2,m2^2}].
How to do it?  

Is there an order to make C12 in standard way like PaVeOrder?  

Best wishes.
