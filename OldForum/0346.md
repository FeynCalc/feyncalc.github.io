Hi all\!  

Are Lorenz indexes properly contracted in lagrangian expressions like as
in Lagrangian["QCD"]?  
I meet absolutely unexpected result of "FeynRule" operation with, for
example, lagrangian like
Lagrangian["QCD"]\*QuantumField[S] for generation of
2gluon-scalar vertex.  

Same problem persists if instead Lagrangian["QCD"] I&\#8217;d
construct needed composition from vector field using "FieldStrength"
utility (or writing strength tensor explicitly).  

Problem do not appear if (1) field arguments in "FieldStrength" are with
different fields (and expecting only 1/2 of required vertex) and if (2)
two strength tensors have different Lorenz indexes, but additional "MT"
tensors are included in lagrangian expression for proper further
contractions.  

It seems that Lorenz contraction is default operation in lagrangian
constructions or in "FeynRule" operation.  

File with calculations I&\#8217;m ready to send if needed.  

Regards, Dimitry.
