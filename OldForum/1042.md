Ok, I think I fixed all the related issues.  

1\) FCFAConvert should now work with amplitudes produced by unpatched  
FeynArts without extra replacements.  

2\) If you put the FeynRules models to the Models directory of the  
patched FeynArts and then run  

FAPatch[PatchModelsOnly -\> True]  

then, the extra model files will be patched in the same way as the  
original FeynArts models.  

So the following now works:  

$LoadFeynArts = True;  
<<FeynCalc\`;  
$FAVerbose = 0;  
FAPatch[PatchModelsOnly -\> True]  

tops = CreateTopologies[0, 2 -\> 2];  
inserttops =  
  InsertFields[tops, {F[4], V[1]} -\> {F[4],
V[1]},  
   GenericModel -\> "SM\_Unitary\_Gauge", Model -\>
"SM\_Unitary\_Gauge",  
   InsertionLevel -\> {Particles}];  
Paint[%, ColumnsXRows -\> {2, 1}];  

FCFAConvert[CreateFeynAmp[inserttops], ChangeDimension -\>
4,  
  LorentzIndexNames -\> {Lor1, Lor2}, IncomingMomenta -\> {p1, p2},  
  OutgoingMomenta -\> {k1, k2}, DropSumOver -\> True, List -\> False,  
  UndoChiralSplittings -\> True,  
  FinalSubstitutions -\>  
   Flatten[Join[M$FACouplings, {SUNFDelta[\_\_] :\>
1}]]] // Contract  

(\*-------------------------------------------------------------\*)  

inserttops2 =  
  InsertFields[tops, {F[4], -F[4]} -\>
{F[5], -F[5]},  
   GenericModel -\> "SM\_Unitary\_Gauge", Model -\>
"SM\_Unitary\_Gauge",  
   InsertionLevel -\> {Particles}, LastSelections -\>
{V[1]}];  
Paint[%, ColumnsXRows -\> {1, 1}];  

FCFAConvert[CreateFeynAmp[inserttops2], ChangeDimension -\>
4,  
  LorentzIndexNames -\> {Lor1}, IncomingMomenta -\> {p1, p2},  
  OutgoingMomenta -\> {k1, k2}, DropSumOver -\> True, List -\> False,  
  UndoChiralSplittings -\> True,  
  FinalSubstitutions -\>  
   Flatten[Join[M$FACouplings, {SUNFDelta[\_\_] :\>
1}]]] // Contract  

(\*-------------------------------------------------------------\*)  

tops3 = CreateTopologies[0, 1 -\> 3];  

inserttops3 =  
  InsertFields[tops3, {F[6]} -\> {F[3],
-F[7], F[10]},  
   GenericModel -\> "SM\_Unitary\_Gauge", Model -\>
"SM\_Unitary\_Gauge",  
   InsertionLevel -\> {Particles}];  
Paint[%, ColumnsXRows -\> {1, 1}];  

FCFAConvert[CreateFeynAmp[inserttops3], ChangeDimension -\>
4,  
  LorentzIndexNames -\> {Lor1}, IncomingMomenta -\> {p1},  
  OutgoingMomenta -\> {k3, k1, k2}, DropSumOver -\> True, List -\>
False,  
   FinalSubstitutions -\>  
   Flatten[Join[M$FACouplings, {SUNFDelta[\_\_] :\>
1}]]] // Contract  

I pushed the changes to the developlment version which you can install
via  

Import["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/master/install.m"]  
InstallFeynCalc[InstallFeynCalcDevelopmentVersion -\> True]  

Looking forward to hear your feedback.  

Cheers,

*\>\>*  
*\>\> In addition, I have another suggestion to solve the current
problem. In FeynCalc, if there is a function to patch the model file
generated by FeynRules, then people can easily use the patched FeynArts.
In fact, I think there already exists such a function. Because, when
installing FeynCalc and patching FeynArts, the model files in
./FeynCalc/FeynArts/Models/ are automatically patched.*
