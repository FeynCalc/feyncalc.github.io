Hi,Vladyslav,  
Happy Holidays\!  

I need some more relations to check the consistency of the OneLoop
result:  
What is the relation between B0(p^2,0,0) and
F=E0(0,0,p^2,0,p^2,0,p^2,p^2,p^2,p^2,0,0,0,0,0) ?  

When I used TID, e.g., " ampssPT = (TID[\#, q, ToPaVe -\> True,
UsePaVeBasis -\> True] & /@  
JPamp) ", I got almost 20 new and unfamiliar functions, E3,
E4,...E444,..D002, D333, etc.  
Is there a source or reference that one can get the relation between
them and, say, B(p^2,0,0)?  
Thanks. JP

Sorry, ignore this part. Somehow I completely forgot that the 1-loop
library of Package-X is loaded not immediately but during the first call
of PaXEvaluate.  

So if you have already done some calculations with PaXEvaluate on a
running kernel, then  

exp = PaXDiLog[2.7, 1] /. PaXDiLog -\> X\`DiLog  

is sufficient. On a fresh kernel just call PaXEvaluate once (with any
input) and then it will work as well:  

$LoadAddOns = {"FeynHelpers"};  
<<FeynCalc\`  
PaXEvaluate[1]  
exp = PaXDiLog[2.7, 1] /. PaXDiLog -\> X\`DiLog  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
