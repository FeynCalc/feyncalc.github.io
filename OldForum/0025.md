Dear Rolf Mertig Professor:  
    
  I have calculate some feynman diagrams of elecweak model.Compairing  
large gauge boson mass,the light quark momentum can be neglected,so  
analytic results will be gotten.I expand B0,C0,D0 functions when  
neglecting external momentum.But I found the results achieved by using  
OneLoop function are different from the results achieved by hand.  
So I chosed a very simple loop integration to check my results,and
find  
maybe OneLoop function is wrong.  
  I write a small function "OneLoopFPI" to imitate the processes of  
calculations by hand Using feynman parameters method in common.I found  
it give the same results with my previous results gotten by hand.  
  I send you a ps file about a very simple question dealing with
OneLoop  
and OneLoopFPI function.Maybe you can find where I was wrong.  
  Thanks for your attentions.
