I found one thread here regarding this problem, but it was for the Mac
system.  

I'm facing this issue with my Windows XP system. I just downloaded
HighEnergyPhysics-4.1.1.0.zip and tried adding the lines  

$FeynCalcDirectory = "C:\\Full Directory Name";  
$VeryVerbose = "C:\\Full Directory Name";  

where "Full Directory Name" is the full path that ends with
"...\\Application Data\\Mathematica\\Applications\\HighEnergyPhysics"  

Unfortunately I'm still getting the error in the title. Any ideas would
be appreciated.  

Thanks in advance.
