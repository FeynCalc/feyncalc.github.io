Hi,  

DoPolarizationSums and FermionSpinSum do not implement polarized  
calculations. But this is not really an issue, since one can do it by
hand  
with some extra code.  

For what concerns the spinors, I would do something along the lines of  
Chapter 7.10 in Bjorken, i.e. put the spin projection operator by hand  
in the right places and then use FermionSpinSum as usual.  

If you have left- and right-handed particles, it is even simpler, since
your  
polarization operator is just GA[6] or GA[7], as in  

https://feyncalc.github.io/FeynCalcExamplesMD/QED/Tree/ElAel-MuAmu  

In the case of vector particles, I would try to express the
polarization  
vectors  
in terms of the kinematic invariants already present in the
calculation,  
e.g. as  
in Section 5.3 of arXiv:0709.1075.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav

*\> Dear FeynCalc author. I am trying to calculate single and double
compton scattering cross section for specified polarization of ingoing

with the use of DoPolarizationSums and FermionSpinSum commands. But how
I can calculate squared amplitude for specified fermion spin and photon
polarizations?*
