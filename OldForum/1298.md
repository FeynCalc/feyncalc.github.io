Hi,  

the stable version of FeynCalc normally receives bug fixes until  
a new stable version is released. The bug fixes go into the
hotfix-stable  
branch  

https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/tree/hotfix-stable  

which is used whenever one installs (or reinstalls) FeynCalc using the  
automatic installer. The bug you are referring to was fixed in January  
2017:  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/commit/365e480f9c6ad9820469c754bf1ae379f7300279\>  

You can just reinstall FeynCalc to have all the current fixes. And  
better check out the hotfix-stable branch from time to time to be sure  
that you are up to date.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
