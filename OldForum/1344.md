Dear Will,  

sorry for that. I introduced some checks to the  
development version to ensure that I do not forget to remove  
any global variables (like Global\`XXX) that I often use for debugging  
FeynCalc. I also updated FeynHelpers accordingly but somehow forgot to  
push that to the repository. Now everything should work again.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
