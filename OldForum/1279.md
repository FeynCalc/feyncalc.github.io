Thank you for your answer. So far it still seems to work. However, even
for lower ranks I receive some kind of recursion mistake again for
certain loop-integrals one example is:  

(p2^Lor1 p2^Lor2 p1^4 ((p1 q))^2)/(p2^2--mG^2).(p1^2--mG^2)^6 =  

\-((-4 + D)\*(-2 + D)\*(2 + D)\*(4 + D)\*TAI[D, 0, {{1,
I\*mG}}]\*  
    (D\*FVD[q, Lor1]\*FVD[q, Lor2]\*TAI[D, 0,  
       {{1, FeynCalc\`ToTFI\`Private\`mM}}] + MTD[Lor1,
Lor2]\*SPD[q, q]\*  
      ((-1 + D)\*mG^2\*TAI[D, 0, {{1, I\*mG}}] -  
       D\*TAI[D, 0, {{1, FeynCalc\`ToTFI\`Private\`mM}}])))/  
  (3840\*(-1 + D)\*D\*mG^4)  

I assume I can replace the internal variable by mG but this seems to me
like a bug somewhere.  

Cheers,  
Philipp
