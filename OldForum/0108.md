Ciao Francesco,  
you might want to use OneLoopSimplify.  
And haved a look at TARCER, it will also do  
1-loop QCD integrals, especially it will reduce them  
to some standard basic integrals.  
This is useful sometimes.  
It is much more general than PaVeReduce since you  
can have arbitrary gauges and thus it will handle  
more complicated integrals.  

Have also a look at Series2 (maybe also look into  
the source code).  
There I tabulated all kind of expansions of hypergeometric  
functions which was needed once for some 2-loop QCD  
OPE-type calculation. Check out  
<http://www.feyncalc.org/Series2/>  

Regards,  
Rolf Mertig
