Hi\!  

I have the same problem with Tr. For example  

Tr[GA[\\[Mu]]]  

gives  

4 \\[Gamma]^\\[Mu] (DiracCanonical-\>False)^2
(Factoring-\>False)^2 (FeynCalcInternal-\>True)^2
(InsideDiracTrace-\>True)^2,  

i.e. it gives also the options and somehow leaves the gamma matrix
untouched. One can also see this behavior, when trying the pair
production example in the help system.  

Does anyone know a workaround?  

Thanks in advance,  

Markus
