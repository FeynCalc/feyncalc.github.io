Hi,  

in fact, since FeynCalc 9.2 GS[0] does evaluate to 0, i.e.  

GS[p] /. p -\> 0  

gives 0, while GA[0]  

evaluates to  

DiracGamma[ExplicitLorentzIndex[0]]  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav

*\> Hello,*  
*\>*  
*\> I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m
working with loop integral involve terms like GS[p], and the
moment
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"
need to be put as zero. But I found something strange:*  
*\>
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*  
*\> In[19]:= GS[p] /. p -\> 0*  
*\>*  
*\> Out[19]=
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[Gamma]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[CenterDot]0*  
*\> ————————————————*  
*\>*  
*\> or you can see it more clearly using the StandardForm*  
*\> ————————————————*  
*\> In[20]:= GS[p] /. p -\> 0 // StandardForm*  
*\>*  
*\> Out[20]//StandardForm= GS[0]*  
*\> ————————————————*  
*\>*  
*\> The result should be zero though. It looks like FeynCalc or
Mathematica treat the GS[] as a function but without definition
of GS[0] =0.*  
*\>*  
*\> Furthermore, when the OneLoop involves the GS[0], it will
become GA[0]*  
*\>
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*  
*\> In[22]:= OneLoop[p, GS[p] /. p -\> 0]*  
*\>*  
*\> Out[22]=
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[Gamma]^0*  
*\>
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*  
*\>*  
*\> Similar thing happens on the SPD[k,p], it will be zero when
you replace one of the moment to be zero, but*  
*\>*  
*\> In[30]:= Spinor[k, MT] SPD[k, p] /. p -\> 0
//*  
*\>*  
*\> Out[30]= 0
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[CurlyPhi](k,MT)*  
*\>*  
*\> or in StandardForm*  
*\> Out[31]= SPD[0, k] Spinor[Momentum[k],
MT, 1]*  
*\>*  
*\> And this
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"
or SPD[0,k] will become GA[0].GA[0] after
applied the OneLoop function in my loop integral.*  
*\>*  
*\> Could you please look into this case?*  
*\> Thank you very much\!*  
*\>*  
*\> Lu Jie*
