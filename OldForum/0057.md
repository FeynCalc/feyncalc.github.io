You did the right thing, but please download the latest version at  
<http://www.feyncalc.org/download/HighEnergyPhysics.tar.gz>  
It has not yet been made an official release because there are still
some  
issues to resolve. But the Mac issues are resolved. I just checked it
by  
downloading and installing on a Mac with Mathematica 4.0.  
Cheers, Frederik
