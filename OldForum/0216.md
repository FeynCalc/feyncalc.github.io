I've been collecting test cases from different computer algebra
systems.  
The effort is called CATS (Computer Algebra Test Suite).  

One of the problems with current systems, like Axiom, is that people  
write some algebra then write some test cases. The test cases are not  
comprehensive, don't test corner cases, and don't test failure modes.  
And, most egregious is, they are not documented. The tests given  
an answer but is it the right answer? So current test cases are only  
really useful as regression tests looking for what's broken.  

So the idea is to collect the various test suites, document the  
underlying math and set up pamphlet files which contain code for  
each of the various systems. You can get the Axiom code pile with  
the CATS work using the tla from Gnu-arch.  

The idea is to develop a test suite that would be similar to the  
NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) classification  
scheme for numerical software but this time for symbolic software.  
Currently there is no classification scheme and no agreed-upon  
test suite.  

There are few enough computational mathematicians. We shouldn't waste  
their time duplicating tests in areas that others have already done.  
Besides, tests are best when written by others :-)  

Thus, CATS.
