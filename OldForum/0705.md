Hi,  
I have found a very strange result in SUNSimplify.  
If I do SUNSimplify[ SUNDelta[i,j]
SUNDelta[i,j]], I would expect the result to be N (it is
just the trace of delta unless I really missed the point of what
SUNSimplify does and what SUNDelta is).  
However I get as a result  
2 CA CF  
that is quite strange.  

Another issue I encountered trying to do computations with color indeces
is that I cannot get rid of \\\\\\\\Delta[1,1] or to substitute
it with 1, and so on...  

Am I missing something?  
Thanks
