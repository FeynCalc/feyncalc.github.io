I have just downloaded the latest version of FeynCalc from your website
and  
am having trouble installing it on my PowerMacG3, running 8.5 and  
Mathematica 4.0. I have installed the folder HighEnergyPhysics on my  
harddrive in AddOns:Applications as I did with my earlier version of  
FeynCalc, but when I try to run fc as you describe I get the message
"Could  
not find FeynCalc installation. Quitting the Mathematica  
kernel." The installation looks correct and Mathematica does find and
open  
other files in Applications so the Path seems to be OK. I have quit
and  
restarted seveeral times but nothing changes. Any suggestions?
