Hello,  

I am trying to calculate traces of some complicated matrix expressions
dotted with GA[5] and get apparently wrong results. (I can check
them by hand.) Originally I suspected Mathematica simply does not
understand my input involving scalar as well as matrix products the way
I think, but I managed to reduce the problem to this:  

expr = GS[a, b, c, d];  
expr /. Dot[x\_, y\_\_] -\> Dot[x, y, GA[5]]  
Tr[%]  

gives the expected result, that is -4ie^{abcd}. However, if I instead
try to perform the trace inside the replacement rule:  

expr /. Dot[x\_, y\_\_] -\> Tr[Dot[x, y,
GA[5]]]  

I get a zero. Where is the problem? I use FeynCalc 8.0.0.beta2 with
Mathematica 8.  
Thanks\!
