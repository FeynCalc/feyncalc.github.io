Hi there  

I have just upgraded from Mathematica 10.0 to Mathematica 11.2. I had
the latest version of FeynCalc installed on Mathematica 10 and
reinstalled it on Mathematica 11.2. I now seem to have issues with the
Write2 command with the option FormatType -\> FortranForm. What happens
is that the lines in my output file are too long (up to 100 or so
characters) and that the new lines do not start with a continuation
character. Consequently I also get the fortran generation warnings
produced by FeynCalc. Have you heard of that issue? Is Write2 somehow
not compatible with Mathematica 11.2?  

Thank you very much in advance.  

Best regards  
Francesco
