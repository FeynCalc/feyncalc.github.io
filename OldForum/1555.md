Hi,  

there is TensorFunction, so you can do something like  

TensorFunction[A, mu, nu] FV[p, rho]\*  
   TensorFunction[B, mu, nu] FV[p, rho] // Contract  

% // FCCanonicalizeDummyIndices  

However, if you seriously need to work with generic tensors (i.e.  
not something made of 4-vectors, metric tensors and  
Levi-Civitas) you might be better off with a genuine  
tensor algebra package. FeynCalc is really very much geared  
towards HEP calculations in flat space, where all you have are lots of  
p^mu, g^{mu nu} and eps^{mu nu rho si} + Dirac matrices  
and 4-vectors in the denominators.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
