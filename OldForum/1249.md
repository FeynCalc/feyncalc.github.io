Hi,  

thanks for the bug report. It is a bug that affects terms like  
(L1 GA[7] + R1 GA[6]) where both projectors appear
multiplied with  
different constants. Should be now fixed. Please reinstall FeynCalc
9.2  
and let us know if you encounter any further issues.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav

Mathematica 8.0.4.)*
