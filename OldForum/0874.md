Okay, several questions have arised...  

1\. Is there a way to specify my own tensor? Metric and LeviCivita are
not enough for me. For example, i'd like this one with lower indices to
be specified: phi\_mu\_nu = diag{0,1,1,0}  

Does FeynCalc contract this kind of predefined tensors?  

2\. When contracting 4 vectors with LeviCivita symbol i get an object
like \\[Epsilon]^(K2\*P1\*P2\*K1)  

I would like either to make this contraction explicit or to replace it
with already known expression.  

But things like  
*\>\>\> M = M /. \\[Epsilon]^(K2\*P1\*P2\*K1) -\>
my\_expression*  
do not work. What's going on?
