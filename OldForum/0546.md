Yeah, it's certainly not for lack of interest that things are moving
so  
slowly - Rolf and I really would like to update and extend FeynCalc
and  
provide more complete documentation and examples. Unfortunately,
making  
a living takes higher priority. Anyone else interested in contributing  
is most welcome. Just drop Rolf or me a line.

Mathematica 7 has this new feature, but feyncalc is not compatible with
it currently. Waiting for new vision\!*
