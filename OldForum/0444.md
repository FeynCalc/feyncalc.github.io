I am totally new to system of Linux. Now I need to install FeynCalc  
on my work PC which is connected to institutional network. Have KDE  
environment. I have Mathematica 5.2 on server, to use. I followed the  
directions and added the HighEnergyPhysics file (fc5beta3.zip.) to  
Applications in .Mathematica folder that appears in my home directory.  
But when I open Mathematica and type "\<\<HighEnergyPhysics \`FeynCalc'"
it  
Â doesnt get initialized as it uses to do on my personal PC. What to  
do????
