I installed yesterday Feyncalc for the first time directly in
Mathematica using the instructions given in the FeynCalc page  

Import["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/master/install.m"];
InstallFeynCalc[]  

I was working perfectly all day. Today I want to start working with the
same Dirac.nb program and it does not find FeynCalc.  

I am using MacOS Sierra 10.12.2  

I have tried to look for the path of FeynCalc, without success, even I
installed the program in the FeynCalc directory in the applications and
it still did not work.  

Any help?
