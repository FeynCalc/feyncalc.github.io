It indicates that your amplitude is not compatible with the chosen
scheme for gamma^5, which is NDR by default. You could for example
switch to BMHV  

$BreitMaison=True;  

In general, the choice of the gamma^5 scheme in chiral theories is a
very subtle issue, so one should very well understand what one is doing.
By understanding I mean not choosing some set of commands that makes the
program spit out some answer, but having an idea how things work on pen
and paper, what are the issues with gamma^5  
in dim reg, why different schemes for g^5 exist and what are their
advantages and disadvantages. Otherwise one cannot arrive to a sensible
results.  

Cheers,
