Just delete this line in FCConfig.m :  

SetOptions[Integrate, GenerateConditions -\> False]  

\------------  

Of course, the fact that  
Integrate[y^2, {y, 0, Infinity}, GenerateConditions -\> False]  
gives 0 in both Mathematica 7 and Mathematica 8 seems a bug to me.  

I reported this to
[support_at_HIDDEN-E-MAIL]
