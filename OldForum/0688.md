No.  
That is probably not possible. FORM is usually used procedurally,  
and Mathematica is ususally used in a more functional way.  
But feel free to send me some of your scripts.  
If I have time and feel like doing so I might translate them.  
If you really need it URGENT, find some money and I will be quicker.
