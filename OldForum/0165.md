I have a number of problems using the PHI package w/ Mathematica 5.0.
When FeynCalc tries to load PHI, I get the following error:  

    ---
    Loading PHI
    MakeBoxes::boxfmt:
       TraditionalForm | HighEnergyPhysics`Phi`Objects`Private`yakk in
        MakeBoxes[p1, TraditionalForm | HighEnergyPhysi<<18>>vate`yakk]
         is not a box formatting type. A box formatting type is any member of
         $BoxForms.
    MakeBoxes::boxfmt:
       TraditionalForm | HighEnergyPhysics`Phi`Objects`Private`yakk in
        MakeBoxes[p2, TraditionalForm | HighEnergyPhysi<<18>>vate`yakk]
         is not a box formatting type. A box formatting type is any member of
         $BoxForms.
    MakeBoxes::boxfmt:
       TraditionalForm | HighEnergyPhysics`Phi`Objects`Private`yakk in
        MakeBoxes[p3, TraditionalForm | HighEnergyPhysi<<18>>vate`yakk]
         is not a box formatting type. A box formatting type is any member of
         $BoxForms.
    General::stop: Further output of MakeBoxes::boxfmt
         will be suppressed during this calculation.

    I then procede w/ the QED Radiative Corrections example, and I get to the point where it attempts to insert the fields:
    ---
    In[9]=inserttops =
        InsertFields[tops, {Photon[0]} -> {Photon[0]}, Model -> "Automatic",
          GenericModel -> "Automatic", InsertionLevel -> Classes];
    StringJoin::string:
       String expected at position 2 in
        ChPT2<>PseudoScalar2[0]<>PseudoScalar2[0]<><<2>><>o2.
    StringJoin::string:
       String expected at position 3 in
        ChPT2<>PseudoScalar2[0]<>PseudoScalar2[0]<><<2>><>o2.
    StringJoin::string:
       String expected at position 4 in
        ChPT2<>PseudoScalar2[0]<>PseudoScalar2[0]<><<2>><>o2.
    General::stop: Further output of StringJoin::string
         will be suppressed during this calculation.
    Get::string: String expected at position 1 in
        Get[ChPT2<>PseudoScalar2[0]<><<12>>2[0]<><<2>><>o2.Gen].
    Get::string: String expected at position 1 in
        Get[ChPT2<>PseudoScalar2[0]<><<12>>2[0]<><<4>><>o2.Gen].
    Out[9]= $Aborted

    I have attempted to isolate the bugs, but a simple grep doesn't find any of the error points.  Any advice would be most appreciated.
