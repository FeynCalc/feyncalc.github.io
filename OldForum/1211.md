*\> I am not very familiar with Larin's scheme, but I would have naively
expected that any gamma5 scheme gives the same output for traces with an
even number of gamma5's, even if the anticommutation of gamma5 is not
allowed in such a scheme. But from what you are saying it seems this is
not true, right?*  

from the purely algebraic point of view this is actually not the case.  
Consider for example the following trace of 6 Dirac matrices in the  
three different schemes  

<<FeynCalc\`  

exp = GSD[p].GAD[mu].GA[5].GSD[p +
q].GAD[mu].GA[5]  

(\* NDR\*)  
$BreitMaison = False;  
$Larin = False;  
r1 = Tr[exp]  

(\* BMHV\*)  
$BreitMaison = True;  
$Larin = False;  
r2 = (Tr[exp] /. {Momentum[p | q, D - 4] :\> 0,  
      Momentum[h : (p | q), D] :\> Momentum[h, 4]}) //
Simplify  

(\* Larin \*)  
$BreitMaison = False;  
$Larin = True;  
r3 = Tr[exp]  

For BMHV I'm using the conventional prescription that the external  
momenta p and q are purely 4-dimensional. So we get  

r1:  
\-4 (-2 + D) (SPD[p, p] + SPD[p, q])  

r2:  
4 (-6 + D) (SP[p, p] + SP[p, q])  

r3:  
2/3 (-6 + D) (-3 + D) (-2 + D) (-1 + D) (SP[p, p] + SP[p,
q])  

In the limit D=4  

r1 /. D -\> 4  
r2 /. D -\> 4  
r3 /. D -\> 4  

all 3 expressions reduce to the same value, as they should  

\-8 (SP[p, p] + SP[p, q])  

However, if the trace is multiplied by a 1/epsilon pole, the results  
look quite different  

Series[FCReplaceD[(r1/Epsilon), D -\> 4 - 2 Epsilon],
{Epsilon, 0,  
1}]//Normal  

8 (SPD[p, p] + SPD[p, q]) - (8 (SPD[p, p] +
SPD[p, q]))/Epsilon  

Series[FCReplaceD[(r2/Epsilon), D -\> 4 - 2 Epsilon],
{Epsilon, 0,  
1}]//Normal  

\-8 (SP[p, p] + SP[p, q]) - (8 (SP[p, p] +
SP[p, q]))/Epsilon  

Series[FCReplaceD[(r3/Epsilon), D -\> 4 - 2 Epsilon],
{Epsilon, 0,  
1}]//Normal  

64/3 (SP[p, p] + SP[p, q]) - (8 (SP[p, p] +
SP[p, q]))/Epsilon -  
  8/3 Epsilon (SP[p, p] + SP[p, q])  

Of course one will also have counter-terms, so this is not the end of  
the story. In particular, both BMHV and Larin's scheme usually require  
extra counter terms that restore the axial Ward identity that gets  
broken in these schemes. NDR respects the axial identity but is  
internally inconsistent.  

So at the end, depending on what you are computing, you might use  
anti-commuting gamma^5 and obtain correct results, but this is not  
something you can always rely on.  

In fact, in arXiv:hep-ph/9302240 Larin was clearly using anticommuting  
gamma^5 on a case by case basis, explaining why this is allowed for
each  
particular computation. In one of the cases he explicitly says that
this  
doesn't work:  

"We can not anymore impose for this purpose the coincidence of the
axial  
and vector vertices (8) because the singlet current generates closed  
fermion loops and we cannot anticommute Î³ 5 outside the singlet axial  
vertex."  

I would also like to point out that arXiv:1506.04517 includes a very  
detailed and interesting discussion of Larin's scheme.  

So, in my opinion, the general rule for Larin's scheme is that one can  
anticommute g^5 only if one understands why this is allowed in the
given  
calculation. Otherwise one should better not, although in many cases  
people do it anyway.

Could you provide some examples (just the trace) where this happens? I  
think it should be possible to optimize DiracTrick for this type of  
structures to make things work faster.
