Test cases.  

While this does not \*prove\* the correctness of the code in a  
mathematical sense, it does in a monte-carlo sense. I note that both  
maxima and axiom have test suites.  

I do not think new mathematical code or subsystems should be accepted  
unless they are accompanied by a thorough test suite.
