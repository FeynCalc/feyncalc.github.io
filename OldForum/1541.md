Hi,  

it's due to the BReduce option of B1 being set to True.  
Which is probably not a good choice for a default.  

In both stable and dev you can use  

SetOptions[B1, BReduce -\> False]  
amp = FVD[k, mu] FAD[{k, m1}, {k + p, m2}]  
TID[amp, k, UsePaVeBasis -\> True]  

In the dev version  

OneLoop[k, amp]  

should work as well, while in the stable version OneLoop  
still reduces everything to B0 and A0, which it actually shouldn't.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
