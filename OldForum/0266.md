That suggestion works very well -  

However, I've found another method from one of the examples at this
site. It was very simple and fast to use.  

To remove spinors one can just write:  

%/.Spinors[\_\_]-\>1  

and the spinors dissappear. So now one can use which ever one wants.  

Thank you very much for your suggestion anyway.
