Maybe you can calculate them like what I did.  
For example, when you get the following expression,  

In[5]:= %/.DiracTrace-\>Tr  
Out[5]= -2 (4 (m2 m4 - p2.p4) 2 p3.ep[p1])
p3.ep(\*)[p1]  

replace ep[p1] by LorentzIndex[mu] and
ep(\*)[p1] by LorentzIndex[nu], and then multiply the
expression by a tensor which is the sum of polarizaion (maybe it is
MT[mu,nu] or something else).
