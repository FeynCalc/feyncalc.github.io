Dear Vladyslav and Mailing List Users,  

I got stuck by something probably very trivial. In short, I wonder what
is the elegant way to include the decay width in an internal propagator.
I have tried to implement it as  

(\*after generating FA diagrams\*)  
ruleResonance = {  
    Mchi -\> Sqrt[(Mchi^2 -
I\*Mchi\*\\[CapitalGamma]chi)]  
   };  
CreateFeynAmp[diagram] /. M$FACouplings /. ruleResonance  

However, after I apply FCFAConvert[], the minus sign is not
picked up right. I think that is because all other minus signs have been
wrapped as "-" while the one I manually inserted in front of
\\Gamma\_{\\chi} is just a regular minus sign. This causes trouble as
later when I do  

(amp[0] (ComplexConjugate[amp[0]])) //  
    FermionSpinSum[\#, ExtraFactor -\> 1/2] & //  
           DiracSimplify // Simplify// FCE //
FeynAmpDenominatorExplicit  

all terms with decay width inserted are not simplified.  
Any input would be appreciated.  

Best,  
Chen
