These are just some private variables inside Tarcer that got exposed  
as the package was not loading properly. Like in  

BeginPackage["test\`"];  
fu;  
Begin["\`Private\`"];  
fu[x\_] := x + y;  
End[];  
EndPackage[];  

fu[2]  

Out[]= test\`Private\`y+2  

It's just Mathematica programming, nothing related particularly  
to Tarcer.  

Cheers,
