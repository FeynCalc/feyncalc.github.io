I have used OneLoop function, the result is expressed involving
B0[pp,0,0].  
I know B0 is the scalar integral of Passarino-Veltman reduction, but I
wonder can also B0 be reduced to some explicit form, just like terms of
log, gamma(Eulers constant) such that?  

Are there some useful function to deal with two-loop amplitudes?  

pre-Thanks\!
