Hi,

*\>*  

Yes, FCGV["parameter"] is a sort of placeholder for a FeynArts
model  
parameter that should prevent clashes with FeynCalc functions. For  
example, SM.mod the top quark mass is defined as MT, which turns to be
a  
shortcut for the metric tensor in FeynCalc.  

The idea is that the user can rename FCGV objects to whatever he/she  
wants after the amplitude is generated. Furthermore, with the option  
SMP-\>True one can get them renamed into SMP objects, which have some  
typesetting attached to them:  

https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/blob/master/FeynCalc/Feynman/SMP.m  

This is pure cosmetics (i.e. SMP's currently have no properties
attached  
to them, except for the way how they are displayed), but it makes the  
TraditionalForm output looks nicer and it avoid introducing dozens of  
new objects (like me, mmu, mt etc.) for masses, coupling constants,  
mixing angles etc. In future I might add something like SMPSimplify to  
have things like alpha\_s = e^2/(4Pi)  
cos\_W^2+sin\_W^2 = 1 transformed, but at the moment there seems to be
no  
need for that.  

Applied to your example:  

FCFAConvert[CreateFeynAmp[inserttops3], ChangeDimension -\>
4,  
 LorentzIndexNames -\> {lor}, IncomingMomenta -\> {p1},  
 OutgoingMomenta -\> {k, k1, k2}, DropSumOver -\> True, List -\>
False,  
 SMP -\> True]  

*\> 2. I find the function LorentzIndexNames in FCFAConvert[]
doesn’t work sometimes, in both 9.0.1 and development version, and for
both default model and added model. For example, after running the
following codes*  
*\>*  
*\> $LoadFeynArts = True;*

*\>*  
*\> I find the option LorentzIndexNames doesn’t work if I set

The problem with your code is that there are in fact two Lorentz
indices  
in the amplitude, so you should supply a list with two elements to  
LorentzIndex names to get the renaming properly  

exp=FCFAConvert[CreateFeynAmp[inserttops3], ChangeDimension
-\> 4,  
 LorentzIndexNames -\> {\\[Nu],\\[Mu]}, IncomingMomenta
-\> {p1},  
 OutgoingMomenta -\> {k, k1, k2}, DropSumOver -\> True, List -\>
False,  
 SMP -\> True]  

Contract[exp]  

LorentzIndexNames is actually another cosmetics option. FCFAConvert  
works without, but then the Lorentz indices are labeled with Lor1,
Lor2,  
Lor3 etc. Since people like to have greek indices (as in papers and  
books), I added LorentzIndexNames so that one can rename "Lor"
indices,  
to whatever one wants.  

Hope this helps.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
