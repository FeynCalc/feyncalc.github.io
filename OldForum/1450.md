Hi,  

I would probably try to cook up some replacement rule, like  

FCI[LC[a, b][p, q] LC[a][r, s, t]
LC[b][r, s, t]] /. {  
   Eps[a\_LorentzIndex, b\_LorentzIndex, rest\_\_]
Eps[a\_LorentzIndex,  
      rest1\_\_] Eps[b\_LorentzIndex, rest2\_\_] :\> 0  
   }  

although I of course understand that with many terms this might be
slow.  
The issue  
is that FeynCalc is not a tensor algebra system, so it cannot put  
certain expressions to  
zero judging purely from their symmetry/antisymmetry properties. One  
would need something like xAct, Cadabra, RedBerry etc. to handle that  
automatically.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
