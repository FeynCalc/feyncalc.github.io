Dear Rolf,  

We appreciate the help understanding these trace bugs.  

Does this bug persist if the traces result from calculating amplitudes
using  
FeyArts/Phi. For instance in the following example  

tops = CreateTopologies[args]  
inserts = InsertFields[tops, ....]  
ampFA = CreateFeynAmp[inserts, ....]  
ampFC = FAToFC[ampFA, DiracTraceEvaluate -\> True]  

Can we assume that the traces in ampFC will be evaluated properly or is
a  
workaround required?  

Many thanks  
Jon Palmer
