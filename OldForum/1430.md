hello&\#65281;  
When i called GA[], i found it that the gamma matrix with a bar,
and the  
function GS[] is also the same. So why? how to solve it?  
Oh, i forgot it. My FeynCalc's version is 9.2.0, and i heard it that the
old version was normal, not with a bar, is't the problem of version?  
My email is
