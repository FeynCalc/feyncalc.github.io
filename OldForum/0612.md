Hi all  
i can't know how to calculate the branching ratio (fraction) of any
process (decay or cross section) by using feyncalc or feynart or
formcalc or looptools?  
my operating system is Linux, i have mathematica 6.0 and feyncalc 6 all
under linux system.  
please, any one help me.  
thanks  
hayam
