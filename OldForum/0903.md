Just in case someone stumbles upon this old mail:  

Performance problems with the context-sensitive input assistant are  
fixed in the development version since April 8th, 2015. This means  
that if you are using this version, you DON'T have to disable the  
predictive interface.  

If there are still any problems with this, please let us know.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav

confused when it sees a couple of hundred extra packages ...*

otherwise, just*

*\> Hello,*  
*\>*  
*\> I found that after I load FeynCalc in Mathematica 9, the input list
suggested from Context-Sensitive Input Assistant, which is a new
function of Mathematica 9, slows down and is very annoying to me. Thanks
for sharing any solution and giving any device\!*
