I missed this response to my old question. I am looking forward to see
this implementation. Thank you for your great works.  

I have also some suggestion. Is it possible for an user to define new
objects and corresponding algebra without touching internal structures
of FeynCalc? For example, metric tensor in (t,z) or (x, y)  
space :  
g\_\\par^{\\mu\\nu} = diag(1, 0, 0, -1), g\_\\perp^{\\mu\\nu} = diag(0,
-1, -1, 0)  
such that  
g^{\\mu\\nu} = g\_\\par^{\\mu\\nu} + g\_\\perp^{\\mu\\nu}  

Four vectors and Gamma matrices are decomposed accordingly. These
structures appear in QFT calculation in presence of a background
magnetic field.
