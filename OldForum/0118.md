Hi,  
Please help me,  
I think that I've found a possible explanation for the strange results  
from Tr[] with GA[5]:  
probably before applay the West formula DiracSimplify[] is
called, now it  
seems that DiracSimplify[] put GA[5] on the right as if
it anticommute  
with GAD[\\mu] and not just by using the cyclic nature of traces
only, as  
it should do in D dimensions, morover in a trace with more than four
gamma  
and Gamma[5] the West procedure and formula in D-dimensions
agree with the  
4-dimensional one (within terms that sum to zero in 4 dimensions) only
if  
the cyclic prescription is followed, so in such case, together with
the  
D-dimensional, the 4-dimensional results are not correct also.  

As an example  
GAD[e,f,5,a,b,c,d]//DiracTrace//DiracSimplify  

gives  
tr{GAD[e,f,a,b,c,d,5]}.  

instead of  
tr{GAD[a,b,c,d,e,f,5]} Point n. 4) page 292 of the West paper.  

Best Regards  
Francesco
