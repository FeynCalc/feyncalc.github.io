Could it be that you are using Mathematica 10.1? That very version  
had a weird bug with FeynArts+FeynCalc almost always knocking out the  
kernel for unknown reason, see my comment here:  

\<https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/115660/quits-kernel-during-evaluation-of-createtopologies\>  

All the previous and posteriors versions are unaffected, so at the end  
I didn't bother to find out the reason.  

On Mathematica 10.3, 9 and even 8 your model works perfectly fine (see  
attachments)  

Cheers,
