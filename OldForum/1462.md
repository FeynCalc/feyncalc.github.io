Ok, after going through the commit log, I see that for Dirac matrices
I  
introduced the indices via the FermionicChain head  

?FermionicChain  

FermionicChain[x,i,j] denotes a chain of Dirac matrices x, where
the  
Dirac indices i and j are explicit. For example,  
FermionicChain[DiracGamma[LorentzIndex[mu]],DiracIndex[i],DiracIndex[j]]  
denotes a standalone Dirac matrix g^mu\_ij. A FermionicChain with only  
two arguments denotes a spinor component, e.g.  
FermionicChain[Spinor[Momentum[p],m],DiracIndex[i]]
stands for the i-th  
component of Spinor[Momentum[p],m]  

?FermionicChainSimplify  

FermionicChainSimplify[expr] simplifies chains of Dirac matrices
with  
explicit Dirac indices wrapped with a head FermionicChain.  

Example  

FCI[FermionicChain[SpinorVBar[p1, m1],
DiracIndex[i]] FermionicChain[  
    GA[mu], DiracIndex[i], DiracIndex[j]]  
   FermionicChain[SpinorU[p2, m2],
DiracIndex[j]]]  
FermionicChainSimplify[%]  

However, apart from some basic tests with QGRAF I didn't pursue it too  
much so far.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
