How exactly do you load FeynArts?  

With the development version it is just  

$LoadFeynArts=True;  
\<\<FeynCalc\`  

provided that FeynArts is in the FeynArts folder inside FeynCalc,  
as described in the wiki:  

$FeynCalcDirectory  
\-\> /home/vs/.Mathematica/Applications/FeynCalc/  

$FeynArtsDirectory  
\-\> /home/vs/.Mathematica/Applications/FeynCalc/FeynArts  

Cheers,
