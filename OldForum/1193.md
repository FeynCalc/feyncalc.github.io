Sorry, I was not suscribed to the mailing list, which I guess was the
reason not to be able to attach files.  
I read that, on Github, it was possible to attach files just dragging to
the text-box and thought that it could be possible that way.  
I just suscribed now to the mailing list. I guess that, after being
accepted, I can just send emails to
[feyncalc_at_HIDDEN-E-MAIL],
is it?  

Sorry for the mess and thanks again,  
Pablo
