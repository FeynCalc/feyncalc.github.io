Dear Professor,  
Sorry to bother you.  
I have a question about Coefficient Funciton of B00, B11.  

I calculate B00 and B11 by hand, and check it with feynclac.I found
there is a term m0^2+m1^2-1/3p^2 in yours, which i do not have. (all
else is same)(also i get same B1)  

And I found out that there is a term same as yours in (D.8) in the
appendix D of the paper by Passiarino and veltman(Nucl. Phys. B 160 1979
151)  

I double double checked my calculation, I can not find where i made a
mistake. So could you tell me where i made a mistake.  

Thanks a lot.  
have a good day\!  
song
