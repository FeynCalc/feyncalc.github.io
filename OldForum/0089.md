Hi Frederik,  
now I am studying some QCD processes and it would be nice to use an  
adapted version of your pach file to translate such amplitudes from FA  
to FC notation (probably paching Lorentz.gen and SMQCD.mod).  
I have tried to do it but without success.  
I am grate to you for your kind last week assistence and I will be in  
debt with you if you will find some time to help me this week.  
However thank you very much also for the time you are reading  
Best Regards  
Francesco Tramontano
