FYI, since our collection of example calculations started to  
become a big mess, I took some time to refactor the codes, introduce  
some unified notation and make things more readable.  

The directory structure has slightly changed. You will still find  
everything in  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/tree/master/FeynCalc/Examples\>  

but the 1-loop QED and QCD calculations that use UVPart are now in  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/tree/master/FeynCalc/Examples/QED/OneLoop\>  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/tree/master/FeynCalc/Examples/QCD/OneLoop\>  

By the way,  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/blob/master/FeynCalc/Examples/QCD/OneLoop/Renormalization.m\>  

contains the 1-loop renormalization of QCD in MS and MSbar schemes.  

Actually, Rolf, Frederik and myself had the idea to add this example  
since our Berlin meeting in 2016. However, only after PaVeUVPart was  
added to the development version it became possible to implement this  
calculation in such an easy and straightforward way.  

Now that we have QED and QCD, the next interesting example would be to  
add the full 1-loop renormalization of the Standard Model.  

Cheers,
