*\>The exchange to tr = TR[Calc[\#]]&; doesn't help.

This is a knows strange feature of Mathematica \!  
Try :  
Unprotect[Times];  
0.\*\_=0;  
Protect[Times];  

Or, if you feel better not modifying Times:  
SetOptions[FCI,FinalSubstitutions-\>{0.\*\_:\>0}];  

However, this will not always work (since FCI is not  
called always internally).  

As for  
Tr[0] not giving 0 :  
TR[0] will give 0.  
The trouble is that Tr has become a Mathematica kernel function in
version 4 or so, but Tr existed before in FeynCalc. So I
Unprotect[Tr] and call TR, but only if there is DiracGamma etc.
in it (do  
??Tr  
to see what I did).  
Feel free to add  
Unprotect[Tr];  
Tr[0]=0
