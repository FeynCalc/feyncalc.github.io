 I've stumbled upon a frustrating bug in the FeynCalcExternal form of  
D-dimensional Eps expressions. Essentially, the expressions behave  
differently depending on how many of their indices are contracted with  
four vectors (and which indices are contracted\!).  
 Attached is a short notebook file that illustrates the point  
concisely. Has anyone else run into this?  

 Thanks,
