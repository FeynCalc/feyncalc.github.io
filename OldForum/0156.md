I have mailed the following message in the topic titled:  
    "MMA 5.0 Beta2 testing".  

 But as Mr. Oliver Lass
\<[olass_at_HIDDEN-E-MAIL]\>
noticed me, it  
is not the suitable place, and I have posted it again  
under the new topic shown above.  

 In addition I report that I could find the origin of the  
"Syntax::stresc " error. This is due to the following  
phrase in the "ConjugateCoupling: usage" in the FeynArts.m  
package:  
        ...,e.g. I \\int d^4x {\\cal}.  

 By changing \\int to \\\\int and \\cal to \\\\bcal, ihe error  
message disappeared. (sorry\! \\ means back slash, as this  
is the Japanese character.)  

 The remaining error is the one relapting the Phi packages.  
I copy it from my previos mail as follows:  

*\> I am testing FeynCalc combined with Phi packages and*  
*\> FeynArts under Mathematica 5.0 trial version.*  
   
 (The trial version is said to be same as official one  
 except save-disabled)  

*\> I corrected the file "QCD/OPEm.m" as Frederik Orellana*  
*\> reported in his Forum-0152 message, and then I input*  
*\> $LoadPhi=True; $LoadFeynArts=True;*  
*\> and loaded FeynCalc as usual with*  
*\> \<\<"HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`".*  

*\> While loading Phi, I got the following error messages:*  
   
*\> TagsetDelayed::Setraw: Cannot assign to raw object p1.*  
*\> TagsetDelayed::Setraw: Cannot assign to raw object p2.*  
*\> TagsetDelayed::Setraw: Cannot assign to raw object p3.*  
*\> General::Stop: Further output of TagsetDelayed::Setraw*  
*\> will be suppressed during calculation.*  

*\> The error seems to occur in the calling of the*  
*\> "variable boxes" in the PhiStart.m, but I could not*  
*\> correct them as yet.*
