Hi\!  

I discovered by now that the problem with Tr does not affect all
computers. I tried it on a different PC (32-bit instead of 64, but this
can't be the reason, can it?) and it did work. Unfortunately the Help
Browser does not work on that macheine: Clicking on an entry crashes
Mathematica.  
So the question is why does it work on some PCs and not on others? It
looks more like a software bug than a hardware problem...  
If anyone had the same problem and knows how to circumvent it, I would
appreciate any tips.  

Regards,  
Markus Huber
