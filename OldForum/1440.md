Hi\!  

I´m working with PaVeReduce, I want to write A0 in terms of B0, then I
write  

SetOptions[PaVeReduce, A0ToB0 -\> True]  
PaVeReduce[A0[m^2]]  
and I get: -((2 m^2 PaVe[0, {0}, {m^2, m^2}])/(2 - D))  

It looks like everything is working good. I have an expression in terms
of many A0,B0,C0,..... lets call it EXP, then I write  

PaVeReduce[EXP]  

but I can´t get the differents A0 in terms of B0. Can someone help me?  

Thank you so much for your time
