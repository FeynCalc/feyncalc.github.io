Dear Adrian,  

yes, in the current stable version it is supported. AFAIK OneLoop is
the  
only function that has issues with the BMHV scheme, which is why it
will  
abort the evaluation in this case. TID, however, works fine  

$BreitMaison = True;  
TID[FVE[l, mu] FV[l, nu] FAD[{l, m1}, {l + p,
m2}], l]  

Notice that FeynCalc does not set the D-4 dimensional components of  
external momenta to zero by default. You can do it either afterwards  
by hand or via something like  

Momentum[p, D - 4] = 0  

The description of West and $BreitMaison have already been updated in  
the development version:

https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/blob/da970cd3cef7ad3b4fcc3a4dc2fb66a3289ac210/FeynCalc/FCMain.m\#L28  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
