Hi,  

sorry for the late reply.  

I'm afraid that there is no straight-forward way to change the sign of  
the anticommutation relation everywhere. The reason is that in most  
cases FeynCalc doesn't apply the anticommutation relation directly,
but  
rather uses known formulas to simplify different chains of Dirac  
matrices (see e.g. Veltman's Gammatrica).  

To have DiracSimplify and DiracTrace work with Euclidean matrices with  
any reasonable performance, one would need to rederive all those  
formulas with the different metric (which possibly someone has already  
did) and reimplement them again. This is of course not impossible, but  
would reqire quite some work and testing.  

You can always do some tricks to make FeynCalc work in your way, e.g.  
multiplying each Dirac matrix with an I to have {i g^mu, i g^nu} = - 2  
eta^munu, but then you still need to be very careful with Gamma 5 and  
the Levi-Civita tensor.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
