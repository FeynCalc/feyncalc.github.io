I just want to make sure this isn't a "property" of TensorFunctions, but
is there no way to define a Rank-2 tensor that is Symmetric:  

TensorFunction[{F,"S"},a,b]  

will give me something "symmetric". But then wouldn't  
TensorFunction[{F,"S"},a,b].TensorFunction[{F,"A"},a,b]  

give zero? Or with the DiracSigma, as its antisymmetric.  

Is there a way to simplify products of TensorFunctions that take into
account their symmetries?
