Hello there.  

To work with different SU groups, the FeynCalc SU(N) functions SUNF,
SUND,  
SUNDelta and SUNT would have to be modified. As it is now, SUNTrace
and  
SUNSimplify return results in terms of SUNN (or CA, CF which depend on  
SUNN) and SUNN is the unique dimension (or number of colors).
Alternatively  
one could modify these functions to take an option, say "SUNN-\>m" and
have  
UNTrace and SUNSimplify check the dimension of things and return results
in  
terms of m instead of SUNN where appropiate.  

This should not be too much of a work, however it's also not done in a  
couple of hours. I'm willing to do it when I find time if there are
others  
needing this feature. Otherwise, you are of course welcome to give it a
try  
yourself and send me the modified files, which I could then
incorporate  
into the distribution.  

Best wishes,  

Frederik
