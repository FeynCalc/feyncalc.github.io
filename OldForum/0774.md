Thanks for reporting these bugs.  

The first one is indeed a serious one. In PHI, I modify Mathematica's
Conjugate to have it expand a bit more than the default, but I seem to
have assumed any exponent would be real. Not good.  

The second one is also a bug. ComplexConjugate is simplistic and assumes
anything not containing an explicit I (Complex) is real. But it used
NumberQ to check for this. Also not good.  

Both have been fixed in CVS and the fixes will be part of the next
release.  

Frederik
