Hi,  

as far as different results on a Mac and Windows are concerned, I
would  
need some explicit examples to look into it. I don't need you full  
notebooks, just some minimal working code that reproduces the problem.  

As to the question what is happening: If you are computing 4D traces,  
then the Eps-terms most likely vanish by Schouten's identity, see e.g.
here  

<[0859.html](0859.html)>  

Again, it's hard to say what happens exactly without some examples.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
