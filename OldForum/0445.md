Hi,  
be careful to use quotes correctly, i.e.:  

\<\<"HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`"  

Furthermore: Be sure to install it in.Mathematica/Applications  

Or, in fact it does not matter where you install FeynCalc.  
Even if it is in, say,  
/opt/HighEnergyPhysics  
You can just load it by  
\<\</opt/HighEnergyPhysics/FeynCalc.m  
or, do :  
PrependTo[$Path,"/opt/HighEnergyPhysics"];  
Needs["HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`"]

I am totally new to system of Linux. Now I need to install FeynCalc  
on my work PC which is connected to institutional network. Have KDE  
environment. I have Mathematica 5.2 on server, to use. I followed the  
directions and added the HighEnergyPhysics file (fc5beta3.zip.) to  
Applications in .Mathematica folder that appears in my home directory.  
But when I open Mathematica and type "\<\<HighEnergyPhysics \`FeynCalc'"
it  
Â doesnt get initialized as it uses to do on my personal PC. What to  
do????
