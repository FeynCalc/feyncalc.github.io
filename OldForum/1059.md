It looks like a compatibility issue between FC 8.2 and Mathematica
10.4,   
which is not surprising, since when it was released Mathematica 8 was  
the most recent version.  

Tarcer from FeynCalc 9 works with Mathematica 10.x, so I don't see any  
reason, why anyone wouldn't want to use that.  

Cheers,
