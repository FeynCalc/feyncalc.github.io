Hello,  

is there some way to uncontract indices in tensor functions? Uncontract
with Pair-\>All seems to only work for scalar products of vectors. Here
is an example:  

Contract[TensorFunction[t, a, b] FV[p, b]];  
Uncontract[%, p, Pair -\> All]  

gives t(a,p). I did not find a way to separate the tensor from the
vector once they are contracted unless I explicitly perform a
replacement on the full form, something like:  

t[LorentzIndex[a\_],Momentum[p\_]]-\>TensorFunction[t,a,b]FV[p,b]  

Is there some more straightforward and systematic way to do this?  
Thanks\!
