Hi,  

The PaVe functions in FeynCalc are more or less placeholders with some  
properties (e.g. symmetries attached to them).  

If you need analytic results you can use the FeynHelpers extension  
(1611.06793).  

For numerics the most straightforward solutions are LoopTools or the  
more recent CollierLink.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav

*\> hello, dear developers and specialists in FeynCalc. I had some
problem with the built-in Passarino Veltman functions such as B0, A0
etc. I need to plot their graphs, howeverWolfram Mathematica doesn't
seem to handle them as ordinary functions.*
