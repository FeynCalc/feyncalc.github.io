    How can i reduce the Gamma matrix production like:  
   
    " C (\\gamma\_a \\gamma\_b \\gamma\_c \\gamma\_d)^T C "  
   
    to " -\\gamma\_d \\gamma\_c \\gamma\_b \\gamma\_a "?  

    when i calculate  

    "
ChargeConjugationMatrix.Transpose[GA[a].GA[b].GA[c].GA[d]].ChargeConjugationMatrix
"  

    in FeynCalc, the charge conjugation matrix C and the transpose form
of gamma matrix is still there.  

    thank you\!
