Hi Vladyslav,  
thank you for yours suggestions.  

I implemented 8-dimensional operator with 4 fermions and 2 derivatives
(via an auxiliary field). Everything seems work well expect when I have
to convert the amplitude.  
This time, there are some momentum on the numerator and I think that the
FCFAConvert function doesn't convert properly the scalar products. In
fact, I get some terms like (-k1).(k1 - p2) which is different form
-Pair[Momentum[k1], Momentum[k1 - p2]]. With
this last expression, I can simplify my expression using
ExpandScalarProduct and using Mandelstam variables.  

As usual, you find my model and the notebook here
