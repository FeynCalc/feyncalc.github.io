Dear all,  

the truncated emails you've been seing on the mailing list were due to a
problem with the PHP email client used when posting directly from the
web site. Things like "quotes" or \<\< or  

Windows newlines  

would confuse it.  

This problem has been fixed now.  

Sorry for the inconvenience,  

Frederik
