Dear FeynCalc users,  

the release of version 9.1 is approaching and I am not  
planning to add any more features to the current development  
version until FC 9.1 is out.  

If you want to help, please install the current development version  
via  

Import["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/master/install.m"]  
InstallFeynCalc[InstallFeynCalcDevelopmentVersion -\> True]  

and check if your codes are working fine.  

I'm currently preparing the change log and looking for apparent bugs.
If  
nothing interferes, I hope that we can have a new release this Sunday.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
