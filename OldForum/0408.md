Dear all,  

our sincere apologies for the latest incident: dozens of emails were by
error delivered to the FeynCalc mailing list. We don't know how this
could happen - the setup has not been changed for a long time, but we
have taken increased security measures and hope not to bother you with
this again.  

Best regards,  
Frederik
