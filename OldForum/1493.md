Hello. I recently started using feyncalc for training purposes. My naive
problem is that when I use the function, the Contract convolves the
four-vector index and Levi-Civita, although I changed it as follows  
SetOptions [Contract, EpsContract -\> False]  
and when I enter Options [Contract], EpsContract -\> False is
displayed. Even if I explicitly write out  
Contract[LC[\\[Alpha], \\[Beta], \\[Mu],
\\[Nu]]\*FV[p, \\[Nu]],  
Â EpsContract -\> False]  
it turns out
\\[Epsilon]^(\\[Alpha]\\[Beta]\\[Mu]Overscript[p,
\_]).  
How to make the indexes do not fold with Levi-Civita? Thank you very
much
