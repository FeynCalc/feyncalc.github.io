Dear Vladyslav,  

I have installed FeynCalc and FeynHelpers following the instructions
from GitHub on a macOS Mojave Version 10.14.6 with Mathematica 12
installed in it.  

I am trying to run your example on page 17 from  

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.06793.pdf  

where PaXSeries is used  

In[6]:=  
          PaXEvaluate[B0[SPD[p,p],0,m^2],PaXSeries-\>{{pp,m^2,1}},PaXAnalytic-\>True]  

but I get the same output as in Out[4]. I have of course copied
all previous lines exactly the same as your example.  

I have already tried the same on Windows 10 with Mathematica 11 and I
get the same inconsistency.  

Thank you very much for any advice.
