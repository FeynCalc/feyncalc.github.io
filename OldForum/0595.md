Thanks Rolf,  
I could'ent make it work at first. But after a minor modification
(calling it TensorFunction2 instead of TensorFunction) it almost worked
according to the intention.  

TensorFunction2[R\_, i\_\_] :=  
 Signature[{i}]\*TensorFunction[R, Sequence @@
Sort[{i}]] /; \!  
   OrderedQ[{i}]  

but this kills canonical order of TensorFunction2[R,a,b,c,d]
while the other symmetries work just fine.  

However by removing the condition "/; \!OrderedQ[{i}]" fixes the
last mentioned problem\! Im not sure if this will create other unknown
problems (by removing that condition).  

Much appreciated\!  
Cheers  
Sharaz
