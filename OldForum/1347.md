Dear Will,  

many thanks for you testing. I've already almost got used to the  
idea of being the sole user of the development version :)  

nmodels should just count the number of models that were patched.  
Nevertheless, there should be of course no error messages, so I pushed
a  
fix for that.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
