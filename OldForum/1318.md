Hi,  

Xiu-Lei is requesting an expansion of the two-point function around  
large external momentum, which is a Landau singular point. At singular  
points like these, and as Vladyslav correctly points out, the result  
depends crucially on the order of the following limits: d -\> 4 and  
mN-\>Infinity. The phenomenologically relevant order is to first take  
the limit d-\>4 then expand in 1/mN, in which case the function is  
represented as an \*asymptotic\* series, involving Log[mN] in
addition to  
powers of mN.  

Unfortunately, as of the current version of Package-X (2.1.0),  
LoopRefineSeries is unable to construct series other than power
series.  
And, with the default setting Analytic-\>False, LoopRefineSeries will  
generate an error message stating that a power series does not exist  
does not exist around mN-\>Infinity.  

The workaround is, as Xiu-Lei does, to use Series to construct the  
desired asymptotic expansion after having converted everything to  
analytic functions Mathematica knows about.  

By setting the option Analytic-\>True, the integral is first expanded
in  
1/mN assuming the number of spacetime dimensions is large enough for
the  
necessary derivatives to exist and hence for a power series  
representation to exist. Then the limit d-\>4 is taken at the end, and  
all the Log[mN]'s which would have appeared in the asymptotic
expansion  
now appear is 1/epsilon poles. You can read more about it in the  
documentation here:  
<http://packagex.hepforge.org/Documentation/HTML/X/ref/LoopRefineSeries.html#759595167>  

Setting the option Analytic-\>True is less phenomenologically
relevant,  
but has some theoretical interest as the result could be understood as  
the contribution from a specific region of the loop integral in the  
context of the method of expansion by regions.
