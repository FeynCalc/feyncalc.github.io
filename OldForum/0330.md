I would like to save Feyncalc outputs in a notebook and be able to
manipulate them as Feyncal expressions even after re-starting Feyncal or
Mathematica.  

The problem I have is this. Say my output is  

g^{ab} p^2 - p^a p^b  

which is of course  

MetricTensor[a,b] ScalarProduct[p,p] -
FourVector[p,a] FourVector[p,b]  

However, I notice that after re-starting Mathematica, starting Feyncal
and then loading the notebook that contains the above expression, these
expressions do not get treated like Feyncalc outputs. For instance  

In: g^{ab} g^{cd}  
Out: g^{ab+cd}  

Is there anything I could do to make Mathematica recognize these
expressions as Feyncalc output so I don't need to re-generate them from
scratch?  

Thanks\!
