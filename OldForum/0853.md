I found some strange behavior for DoPolarizationSums. Let  
tmp = Conjugate[PolarizationVector[p, mu]]
PolarizationVector[p, nu]  

1\) DoPolarizationSums[tmp+1,p] gives  
3+e\_{mu} e\_{nu}  
which is ok for number, but this command did nothing with
polarizations.  

2\) DoPolarizationSums[tmp+1,p,0] gives  
4-g\_{mu,nu}  
which is ok for tensor structure, but I expected 2 as a number.  

3\) DoPolarizationSums[tmp+1,p,p] gives  
2 + (-g\_{mu,nu} + p\_{mu}p\_{nu}/p^2)  
which is ok for gluons, but it is not applicable for massive patricles
because of 2, then 3.
