Hi,  

since FeynCalc by itself does not generate any amplitudes, the overall
sign  
completely depends on what you give it as an input expression.  

For FeynArts input the sign depends on the model

Cheers,

FeynCalc to compute amplitudes? Obviously, the amplitude does not depend
on the signature of the metric. What about instead the overall sign? Is
the amplitude defined as in Schwartz's QFT book (see Eq.(24.7) ) ?
Thanks.*
