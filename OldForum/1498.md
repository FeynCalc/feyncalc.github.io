Hi Will,  

I suspect that this might be related to the recent change in the syntax
of  
PropagatorDenominator in FeynArts  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feynarts-mirror/commit/73094019d93c8a11cf8eee7189e5514a8e9154d6\#diff-cc9305310a3b0771b5c2045c39d7cc73R491\>  

This should only concern propagators raised to some powers and my
examples  
from the test suite (including self-energies with gauge terms) seem to  
work fine.  

Could you please send me the output of CreateFeynAmp for one of the  
diagrams that  
generates this sort of ouput:  

CreateFeynAmp[...]//InputForm  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
