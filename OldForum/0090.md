Hi Francesco.  

I looked at using SMQCD.mod and decided to make a few small changes to  
FeynCalc. With these changes, the built-in FeynArts model files can be  
used (at least SMQCD, SMc, QED and SM). You have to reinstall FeynArts  
though (to have the model files patched).  

I've uploaded the changes (plus a lot of other changes, mostly to PHI)  
to the CVS repository and made a checkout to HighEnergyPhysics.tar.gz  
avaliable on the download page of the website.  

Attached is a notebook to get you started. I haven't checked the  
physics; please let me know if the results look sensible...
