Dear All,  
Sorry bothering you but I am trying to install the FeynCalc
package,but  
unfortunately i get an error message.After giving  
\<\<HighEnergyphysics\`fc\`i get  

"Could not find FeynCalc installation. Quitting the  
Mathematica \\  
kernel."  
After downloading the tar.gz file from the site i unstuffited the file  
under /AddOns/Applications.....the operation created a folder  
HighEnergyPhysics.  
Then opened Mathematica i typed \<\<HighEnergyPhysics\`fc\`  
and the quoted message above appeared...What am i doing wrong...  

I am using a Mac and the version of Mathematica i have is 4.1  
PLEASE,HELP\!\!\!\!  

ps " This is one of the first time i am using Mathematica."  
So i am largely unexperienced with the software  
Thanx for your time  
looking forward to your reply
