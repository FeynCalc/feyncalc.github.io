Regarding the second question:  

TarcerExpand has an option TarcerReduce which is set to
$BasisIntegrals.  

$BasisIntegrals is the list of integrals for which TarcerExpand knows  
the analytic expressions. This can be extended as needed.  

Cheers,

*\> I am trying to use Tarcer to analyse some two loop self-energy
diagrams. I would like to understand the divergent and finite parts of
the integrals. At first look it seems like TarcerExpand might do the
trick but it seems to have very limited knowledge of basis integrals. I
have two questions:*  
*\>*  
*\> 1. Is there a reerence for the derivation of the integral
expressions that TarcerExpand does understand.*  
*\> 2. Can TarcerExpand be extended to include other integrals and if so
how?*  
*\>*  
*\> Many thanks,*
