Hi,  

Thank you for the detailed explanation.  

1\. “I would suggest that you use unpatched FeynArts + FeynRules on a
separate Mathematica kernel, then save the results and load them into
the FeynCalc session, where you can process them further. “  

In fact, that's what I did recently.  

2\. Now, I generate the amplitude in unpatched FeynArts and save it in a
file. Then, I load the file in FeynRules. The next step is to convert
the amplitude to the form required by FeynCalc. As explained in
1601.01167, I choose the function FCFAConvert[]. However, the
function doesn’t work, except using the following commands first:  

amp=amp/.{FeynAmpList -\> FAFeynAmpList, NonCommutative -\>
FANonCommutative,  
   DiracSpinor -\> FADiracSpinor};  
FCFAConvert[amp]  

I guess FCFAConvert[] only works for amplitudes generated by
patched FeynArts. If so, is it possible to make FCFAConvert[]
work for the amplitudes generated by unlatched FeynArts?  

Best,  
Xing-Bo Yuan
