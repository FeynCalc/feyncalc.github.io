Hello Vladyslav,  

Thank you very much for your answer. I did load the add-on exactly as in
your example on arXiv and I still get the same issue. I was using
FeynCalc 9.2 when I found this problem so I decided to try with the 9.3
version but the problem remained. You can find the Mathematica code I am
using in the following GitHub link:  

https://github.com/cristiansierraf/FeynHelpers-test.git  

There are two files, the one I used for the installation and another one
with the example itself. I restarted Mathematica as indicated.  

Apparently PaXEvaluate works perfectly while PaXSeries does not.  

Thank you again four your help,  

Cristian
