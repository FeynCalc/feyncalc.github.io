Hi Duarte,  

hmm, on my machine (Mathematica 11.3, latest FeynCalc 9.2 stable from  
the repository) the above code produces the final result without any  
traces or Lorentz indices (see attachment).  

I think that the last fix that might have something to do with your  
issue is from Jun 14, 2017:  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/commits/hotfix-stable\>  

So if you don't have that, you should reinstall FeynCalc 9.2 using the  
automatic installer and try again.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
