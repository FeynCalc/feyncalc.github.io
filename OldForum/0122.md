First a remark: All these so-called Gamma5 schemes are not  
very clear and solid, so the best is to just avoid  
having to calculate traces with 6 or more gamma matrices  
and gamma5. This can be done with a tensorial decomposition  
as described in  
Zeitschrift f√ºr Physik C  
Year: 1996  
Volume: 70  
Page range: 637-653  

The functions in FC to do this
are:<http://www.feyncalc.org/FeynCalcBook/TIDL>  
and  
<http://www.feyncalc.org/FeynCalcBook/TID>  
and also (only one-loop) OneLoopSimplify.  

Having said that, yes, sometimes there seems to be no  
way out or things are easier or whatever and you do  
want traces of 6 gammas and gamma5 in D dimensions.  
And yes, you found a bug. Thanx.  
I fixed it.  
Until it gets into the next official version (you are  
welcome to help Frederik to do this) everybody can  
replace their FeynCalc.m by  
<http://www.mertig.com/FeynCalc0327.m>  
(rename to FeynCalc.m, but maybe save the old one).

FeynCalc4.1.2 Type ?FeynCalc for help or visit

$PrePrint is set to FeynCalcForm. Use FI and FC to change the display
format.
