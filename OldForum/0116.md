Hi,  
sorry for the late answer.  

There is still a slight problem if you install FC into the  
$UserAddOnsDirectory  
You can fix it as follows (this is on Linux, but the same approach
should  
work on Mac or Windows):  
create a file fc with the lines:  
HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`$FeynCalcDirectory="\~/.Mathematica/Applications/HighEnergyPhysics";  
\<\<HighEnergyPhysics\`fc\`  

then:  

[rolf@colossos rolf]$ math  
Mathematica 4.2 for Linux  
Copyright 1988-2002 Wolfram Research, Inc.  
Â -- Motif graphics initialized --  

In[1]:= \!\!fc  
HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`$FeynCalcDirectory="\~/.Mathematica/Applications/HighEnergyPhysics";  
\<\<HighEnergyPhysics\`fc\`  

In[1]:= \<\<fc  

FeynCalc4.1.1 Type ?FeynCalc for help or visit
<http://www.feyncalc.org>  
$PrePrint is set to FeynCalcForm. Use FI and FC to change the display
format.  

In[2]:= $UserAddOnsDirectory  

Out[2]= /home/rolf/.Mathematica  

\<I failed to install FeynCalc on Mathematica 4.2. Does anybody has  
\<experience with this?
