Dear Vladyslav,  

thank you so much for all the help.  

I come to you now with another question. Feyncalc thinks that
B0(0,0,0)  
is zero (where B0 is the Passarino-Veltman usual function). But the  
truth is that B0(0,0,0) is doubly divergent: infrared (because we have  
ln 0) and UV (because of the 1/\\epsilon divergence).  

So what's happening here? How come does Feyncalc think B0(0,0,0)=0?  

Best regards,  
Duarte
