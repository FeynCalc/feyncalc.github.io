Professor, I met a problem when using FC5:  

DiracTrace[GA[m].(GA[n].GA[6] +
GA[n].GA[7])]  

gives result 0,while  

Calc[DiracTrace[GA[m].GA[n]]]  

gives non-zero result.  

As GA[6]=(1+GA[5])/2 and
GA[7]=(1-GA[5])/2, I guess it is a bug. The method "tr =
TR[Calc[\#]]&; " also seems not useful for the
problem.  

Could you tell what the metter is?  

Thank you very much\!
