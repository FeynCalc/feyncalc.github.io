Dear FeynCalc developers,  

first of all, thanks for the excellent job.  

I was trying to calculate a tree level process with a specific
polarisation vector for some incoming photons. Google pointed me to an
old paper, <http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9710265>, where they quote the
function SpecificPolarization[..] which apparently is not there
anymore.  
In substance, is there a way to specify a polarisation vector so that a
polarized amplitude can be calculated simply by contracting this
specific vector with the remaining part of the latter?  

Thank you for your help,  
LK
