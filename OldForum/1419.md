In fact, now it is :) The new SFAD/CFAD/GFAD syntax of the development  
version supports arbitrary sign mass terms, so one can also enter  
propagators of the form 1/(p^2+m^2):  

SFAD[p, {p, -m^2}]  

and of course you can also change the sign of I\*eta:  

SFAD[{p, {0, -1}}, {p, {-m^2, -1}}]  

The only loop-related function that can currently deal with these new  
objects is ApartFF (since yesterday):  

ApartFF[SFAD[p, {p, -m^2}], {p}]  

ApartFF[SFAD[p, p + q, {p - q, m^2}], {p}]  

ApartFF[SFAD[p, p + q, {p - q, -m^2}], {p}]  

Unfortunately, FDS still cannot simplify SFADs and CFADs, so the
output  
of ApartFF is not maximally simplified. Tensor reduction is also not  
possible yet. The support for FDS and TID (at least at 1-loop level)
is  
being worked on.  

Cheers,

compute Feynman Diagrams using euclidean propagators like 1/(p^2 + m^2)
in the euclidean space?*
