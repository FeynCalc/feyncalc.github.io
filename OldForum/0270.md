i've used feyncalc extensivly in my diploma thesis and still use it
heavily for my work. for example switching to different gauges is a
matter of minutes whereas it'd take me a week to recalculate all the
diagrams by hand. i know nowadays there is plenty of software round to
deal with this, anyways  

thanks
