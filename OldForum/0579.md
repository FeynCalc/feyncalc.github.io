Hi\!  

The propagator of type external for the Fermion (in QED) is given by the
following expression:  
AnalyticalPropagator[External][ s F[i, mom] ] ==
NonCommutative  
[DiracSpinor[-mom, Mass[F[i]], Sequence@@
@Drop[{i}, 1]] ],  

Would you please just tell me what does it mean this:  
Sequence@@ @Drop[{i}, 1]]  

Thank you in advance  
Karima
