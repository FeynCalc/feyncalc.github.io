When you load FeynCalc, if it is not already set so, the default output
format type is set to TraditionalForm. This means you cannot paste
output back as input. In order to do so, you must set the default output
format type to StandardForm (under the "Cell" menu), but then
expressions are considerably less readable. To save and resume a
previous session you can use DumpSave (see ?DumpSave). Personally I
usually save a notebook and reevaluate it when resuming work.  

Cheers, Frederik
