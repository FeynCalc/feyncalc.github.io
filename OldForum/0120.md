There have been previous messages about a bug in the evaluation of  
Tr[DiracSlash[p,p]] giving p^2 instead of 4p^2. Rolf
posted a fix, which  
is incorporated into the new version. I have the new version, but
still  
get p^2 as the answer. However, Purnendu Chakraborty, responding to a  
query by Roberto Sghedoni, claimed to get 4p^2.  

So what is going on? How can 2 people running the same version get  
different answers? In exploring this, I stumbled across a bizarre bug.
The  
answer is that it depends on how FeynCalc is loaded\!  

For example, loading FeynCalc.m directly, one gets the right answer:  

In[1]:= \<\<FeynCalc.m  

FeynCalc4.1.1 Type ?FeynCalc for help or visit
<http://www.feyncalc.org>  
$PrePrint is set to FeynCalcForm. Use FI and FC to change the display  
format.  

In[2]:= Tr[DiracSlash[p,p]]  

           2  
Out[2]= 4 p  

However, loading FeynCalc in the recommended way gives the wrong
answer:  

In[1]:= \<\<HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`  

FeynCalc4.1.0.3b Type ?FeynCalc for help or visit
<http://www.feyncalc.org>  
$PrePrint is set to FeynCalcForm. Use FI and FC to change the display  
format.  

In[2]:= Tr[DiracSlash[p,p]]  

         2  
Out[2]= p  

What gives? Peter
