Dear Peter,  

thanks for your interest in FeynCalc. This is indeed a nice
observation  
and a useful suggestion. Commutator and AntiCommutator are pretty much  
standalone functions (except for some use in DotSimplify) so that one  
can improve them without much worrying about breaking higher level
routines.  

I implemented your idea which is now in the repo:  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/commit/2ae75579be65565570b40a59424290e0058a2c24\>  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
