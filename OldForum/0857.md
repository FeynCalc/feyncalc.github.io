By the way, you can also demand that the auxiliary vector n^mu that
enters the polarization sum satisfies n^2=0. Then the term that bothers
you will not appear at all.  

This is for example done in Ellis, Stirling and Weber, QCD and Collider
Physics Eq. 4.61 or in this lecture note  

\<https://cds.cern.ch/record/454171/files/p41.pdf\>  

by Magnano (Eq. 28). For this reason, in real computations (see e.g.
Field's Applications of QCD, Eq. 7.2.59) it is often convenient to take
the four momentum of another gluon to be the auxiliary vector, as it
automatically satisfies n^2=0. Such tricks simplify the computations but
do not change the final result for physical, gauge independent
quantities.  

Cheers,
