Hi,  

this might be a stupid question but how do I get Feyncalc 8.0.0 beta3
to  
evaluate diagrams generated by the patched 3.4 Feynarts version? I  
didn't find anything in the manual of FeynArts or documentation of
FeynCalc.  

The output of CreateFeynAmp looks a bit weird. Why is there still an  
integration although it's a tree level process. Moreover does the
output  
in the FeynArts manual looks quite different from the one produced
here.  
And how can i just look at the plain expressions for amplitudes
without  
doing any sums over external states or so?  

Find attached an example.nb  

Thanks in advance\!
