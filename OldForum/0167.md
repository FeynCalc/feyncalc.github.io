I find that if I replace instalation of FeynCalc w/ the the beta
version, then make the changes that you suggest, that the FeynCalc, Phi,
and FeynArts(v. 3.2) all boot correctly (no errors). I then run the QED
example, and find that I must replace the line:  

amplFC = afc /. DiracTrace -\> Tr // Simplify;  

with  

amplFC = afc /. MatrixTrace[X\_\_] -\>
Y[List[X]] /. List -\> Dot /. Y -\> Tr // Simplify  

In order to get the trace performed (with similar subs in the remainder
of the notebook).  

MMA v. 5.0 is quite pedantic about the integrations, so one must tweak
the integrals to get the rest of the calc to go, but everything else
looks OK.
