Hi Ismail,  
yes, I know, there is something weird.  

    -- 
    Regarding efficiency:
    Please use
    ScalarProduct[p,p]=mt2
    and
    ScalarProduct[k,p] = ...
    and
    ScalarProduct[k1,k1]=0
    etc.
    (This will set  also   Pair[Momentum[...], Momentum[...]]  and this is what is used inside OneLoop ).
    -- 
    Try to do things without OneLoop. Just OneLoopSimplify.
    Or, probably better, use FormCalc, which will definitely be much faster than FeynCalc:
