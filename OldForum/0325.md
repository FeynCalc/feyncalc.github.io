I'm a brand new user of FeynCalc, so my question is probably simple to
answer.  
I have the following problem. I define a four vector as  

FourVector[t,alpha]=expr, (1)  

where expr is a complicated expression containing Levi Civita tensors
(with at least 3 contracted indeces). When I square this four vector
using  

Contract[FourVector[t,alpha],FourVector[t,alpha]]  

the result is an expression where most of the Levi Civita tensors with
an index alpha are not contracted.  

How can I contract these tensors ?  
Do I use the correct way in (1) to store a four vector under the name t
?  

Thanks.
