Hello Everyone,  
does anybody know, if one can use Feyncalc in Euclidean space just
like  
in Minkowski space? Or in different words, do the LeviCevitta Tensor
or  
the metric tensor have explicit representations when used for  
calculations?  
We would be happy, if anyone could answer this question or could give
us  
a hint how to find out. Thank you.  
Tim
