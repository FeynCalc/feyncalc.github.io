Hi,  

in addition to what Aliaksandr wrote,  
there is also the FeynRule function which doesn't require Phi  
\<<http://www.feyncalc.org/FeynCalcBook/FeynRule/index.html>\>  

Furthermore, FeynArts has a ModelMaker routine (see chap 7.5 of  
\<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FeynCalc/feynarts-mirror/master/manual/FA3Guide.pdf\>)  
that is supposed to be able to generate  
Feynman rules from the given Lagrangian. That is probably the most  
useful tool to use if you want to evaluate the resulting diagrams  
with FeynCalc.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
