Dear Vladyslav,  

I have Full Lagrangian of Randall-Sundrum Model. I want to generate
feynman rules for graviton in Randall-Sundrum model and apply them for
cross-section calculation.  
Would you please guide me to define New Lagrangian and generate their
feynman rules?  
And also How can apply them to calculate cross-section?  

All the Bests,  

Mahdi
