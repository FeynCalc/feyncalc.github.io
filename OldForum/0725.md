Looks like in the Phi "Couplings.m" where everything is defined starts
labeling the momenta from incoming particles, then outgoing are  

Â \<\> ToString[b + ((ParticlesNumber/2)  

which means if there was 3 incoming and 2 outgoing, it would relabel the
outgoing k\_1 to p\_(1+ 4/2 = 3) by default, though there already is a
p\_3 in the incoming.  

Was FAToFC meant to only be used for amplitudes with even numbers? So as
it is I can fix this by using FAToFC with the option ParticlesNumber-\>
6 (where 6 is twice the number of incoming particles)
