Hi,  
yes, I think that happens because the "predictive interface" gets
confused when it sees a couple of hundred extra packages ...  
Anyway, you can either do, once:  

SetOptions[$FrontEnd, "ShowPredictiveInterface" -\> False]  

Or, maybe better, if you do actually want the predictive interface
otherwise, just  

SetOptions[$FrontEndSession, "ShowPredictiveInterface" -\>
False]  

(which you could also add to FeynCalc.m or wherever)
