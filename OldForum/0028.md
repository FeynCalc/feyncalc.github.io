I have downloaded and unzipped FeynCalc. I have set up in my AddON  
Applications file the HighEnergyPhysics file and all the files look  
okay. I am not able to start either using the Start Button or with the  
call \<\<HighEnergyPhysics\`fc\`. I am told by Mathematica that it
cannot  
find FeynCalc. I am running on Mathematica 4.0. Thanks.
