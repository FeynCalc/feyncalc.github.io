To Lingxiao Xu  

As far as I know there was a package called Phi
<http://www.feyncalc.org/phi/>.  
I am not aware of the status of this package but it allowed to obtain  
couplings right from the lagrangians for some theories and was available
in  
FeynArts/FeynCalc. There is FeynRules package  
<http://feynrules.irmp.ucl.ac.be/> for doing that but I did not use
it.
