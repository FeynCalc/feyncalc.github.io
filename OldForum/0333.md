Hi,  
could you send me the relations in a Mathematica notebook  
to
[rolf_at_HIDDEN-E-MAIL]
?  
I will try to add it to Tarcer.  

TARCER.nb is not that advanced really.  
Maybe we should have documented it better...  

    --
    Frederik and I and are thinking of giving a 
    Mathematica/FeynCalc/Phi/Tarcer course next year (probably
    March).
    Working with and extending of TARCER.nb could be part of
    such a 2 or 3-day course.
    Regards,
    Rolf
