2 Lingxiao Xu:  

I would suggest to check how factors introduced by Peskin and Shroeder
are  
related to the C\_0 decomposition at certain relation of higgs and
quark  
mass, the factor 3 came from there. That is not related to the Feyn
Calc  
per se, it rather the matter of definition of the I(m\_H/m\_q) from
C\_0.
