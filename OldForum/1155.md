Hi,  

thanks, should be now fixed:  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/commit/b78c3c4c47c748e3ad6c37ea349d190b1ff4a271\>  

Please rerun the automatic installer to  
have the fix applied.  

P.S. In general, to be on the safe side, I would recommend  
to restart Mathematica, if the kinematics is changed. Earlier  
versions of FeynCalc massively employed caching ("memoization"  
in Mathematica lingo) to speed things up. While caching on its own  
is ok, issues like the one you observed appear when scalar products  
are assigned to particular values and then reassigned to other values.  

I implemented a safe caching mechanism some time ago  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/blob/master/FeynCalc/Shared/CacheManagement.m\>  

but it is a lot of work to adjust things on existing functions
(especially  
those for which we don't have many unit tests), so I'm  
doing it succesively. Of course, for new functions like ToPaVe caching  
should work without any issues.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav

mZ^2 in the coefficient of the function, but not in the argument of the
PaVe integral. I was wondering if there was any way to clear this
manually? Thanks so much for your time\!*
