Hi,  
the installation directory of FeynCalc should be on  
$Path.  
If it is not, you can put it in there by  
AppendTo[$Path,"/home/mydir/"]  

Or, just load FC by full path-name  
\<\</home/mydir/HighEnergyPhysics/FeynCalc.m

Hi,  

How come I can only access Feyncalc if I open mathematica from the
.Mathematica/Applications directory? Is this normal behavior or do I
have to set some environment variables?  
If I open mathematica from, say, my home directory I get this error:  

<<HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`  
Could not find FeynCalc installation. Quitting the Mathematica kernel.
