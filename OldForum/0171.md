Dear list subscribers.  

To get rid of all the spam on the list I upgraded the mail system and  
changed the mail setup of the feyncalc user.  

Unfortunately in the new setup, '\#' was no longer treated as a
comment,  
resulting in the system trying to deliver to a lot of non-valid
addresses.  

My sincerest apologies for all the junk that ended in your mailboxes.  

Frederik Orellana
