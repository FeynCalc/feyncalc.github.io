Like many of you I would imagine, I use mathematica on the school's lab
computers. These computers do not let you install anything into the
program files directory which means, as written, FeynCalc doesn't run.
There is an easy fix however.  

First, when you extract FeynCalc you must extract it into the following
directory:  

C:\\Documents and Settings\\$User\\Application
Data\\Mathematica\\Applications  

(note: $user is your log-on name for the computer). By default this
dirctory is hidden so you'll have to choose to display hidden folders in
the windows options.  

After you have extracted FeynCalc find the following file:  

C:\\Documents and Settings\\$user\\Application
Data\\Mathematica\\Applications\\HighEnergyPhysics\\FeynCalc.m  

Open it in a text editor (wordpad for instance) and change the following
line:  

    HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`$FeynCalcDirectory =  
    ToFileName[{$TopDirectory, "AddOns", "Applications",
"HighEnergyPhysics"}]  

So that it reads as follows:  

    HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`$FeynCalcDirectory =  
    ToFileName[{$UserBaseDirectory, "Applications",
"HighEnergyPhysics"}]  

This line is near the top of the file and you should be able to search
for it easily. I made this change in version 4.1.1.0.  

To the authors of this program: I am very much appricitive of this great
piece of softwear but I would hope you would consider adding this into
future versions so that all of us on lab computers can more easily use
this program.  

Hope that helps\!
