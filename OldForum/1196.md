Thanks for your example. You are right, there should be an extra minus  
sign.  

In fact, the original implementation is indeed a bit weird, so I
rewrote  
it in the master branch and added a warning about IR divergences  
spoiling the reduction.  

Anyhow, this should be now fixed in both branches. Please check if it  
works for you and let me know if there are still issues.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
