Hi,  

sorry for the late reply. I'm afraid that this is not something one
can  
easily achieve with FeynCalc. By default FeynCalc doesn't distinguish  
between upper and lower indices, which is crucial for working with  
Cartesian vectors. One can of course start writing some own code on
top  
of FeynCalc, but very soon it quite messy and error-prone.  

Unless you find a good way to rewrite things in a covariant way,
working  
with Cartesian vectors is not supported out of the box.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
