Hello\!  

I've just switched from Mathematica 7 and Feyncalc 4 to Mathematica 8
and Feyncalc 8. Unfortunately the calculations have become terribly slow
in the new version. How does this come about? The notebook file which
runs really fast with the old programme is slow like a turtle in with
the new setup. I've tried Feyncalc 8 with Mathematica 8.0.0 and 8.0.1.
No difference.  

Thanks in advance
