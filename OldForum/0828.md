Dear Feng,  

I tested you code with old FeynCalc and can confirm your observations:  

FeynCalc 4.2.0 pre1, Mathematica 5: 4.3 seconds  

FeynCalc 9.0, Mathematica 9: 13.5 seconds  

It is roughly a factor of 3 slowdown, unfortunately.  

I will try to investigate this. The number of changes in the relevant  
functions between Release-4\_2\_0\_0 and Release-5\_0\_0\_0-beta3 is not
that  
big so we should be able to trace the problem in a resonable amount of  
tume. Git bissect is a particularly nice tool for doing this kind of  
investigations.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
