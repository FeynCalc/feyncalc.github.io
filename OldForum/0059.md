Hi Jelena.  

I am still involved so don't apologize :-) But please send questions
like  
these to
[feyncalc_at_HIDDEN-E-MAIL];
then others can answer too.  

Under Windows 2000 I don't have any problems and unfortunately I don't
have  
any Windows 98 installation around. You might want to try setting  
HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`$FeynCalcDirectory explicitly before
loading  
FeynCalc and/or find out why  
FileNames["\*",{HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`$FeynCalcDirectory}]
== {} yields  
True.
