Dear author,  
I'm calculating the decay width of a massive neutrino decaying to three
SM neutrinos through a Z boson. But when I want to calculate the squared
amplitude (including fermion spin sum), I get the following error
message:  

"Error\! DiracTrace has encountered a fatal problem and must abort the
computation. The problem reads: Trace still  
contains chiral projectors.  

I realised that the product of the amplitude and its conjugate contains
terms with "gamma^$AL($188)" and "gamma^$AL($189)", and I don't really
know what it is. Besides, the amplitude I get with FeynArts seems to be
right.  

Thank you very much for your time,  
Bests,  

Paulina
