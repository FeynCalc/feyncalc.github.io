Dear FeynCalc users,  

FeynCalc 9.3.1 is now officially released. As usual, you can use the  
automatic installer to install or upgrade:  

https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/wiki/Installation  

This is a minor release with only few changes/improvements that sets  
stage for an upcoming publication on using FeynCalc in nonrelativistic  
effective field theory calculations.  

Changes as compared to FeynCalc 9.3.0 are listed in the changelog  

https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/blob/master/FeynCalc/Changelog.md  

Have fun\!  

Best regards,  
FeynCalc Developer Team
