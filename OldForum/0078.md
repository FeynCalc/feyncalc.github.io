Hello.  

First of all, don't usually expect to get anything reasonable out of  
factors with more than two occurrences of the same index. FeynCalc
assumes  
the usual Einstein summation convention, but cannot judge what to do
in  
cases like x\*x.  

Try  

x=LC[a,b,c,d]FourVector[k1,a]FourVector[k2,b]FourVector[k3,c]FourVector[k4,d];  
y=LC[e,f,g,h]FourVector[k1,e]FourVector[k2,f]FourVector[k3,g]FourVector[k4,h];  
x y // Contract  

W.r.t. writing out x in terms of scalar products, this would amount to  
writing out the Levi-Civita tensor in terms of Kronecker deltas. I
don't  
believe this is possible?  

Regards, Frederik Orellana
