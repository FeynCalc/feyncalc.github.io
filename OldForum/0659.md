Dear FeynCalc users,  
there is a new version of FeynCalc ready:  
<http://www.feyncalc.org/download/fc802.tar.gz>  
or  
<http://www.feyncalc.org/download/fc802.zip>  

I fixed a few problems and improved documentation.  
Some of the examples in HighEnergyPhysics/fcexamples  
have also been fixed.  

The way Tarcer works has been changed slightly: there are now  
operating system dependent .mx files in HighEnergyPhysics/Tarcer  
If people want also 32-bit Linux, 32- and 64-bit MacOSX .mx files:  
please evaluate HighEnergyPhysics/TARCER.nb and send me the resulting
.mx files (I still do not have a Mac computer).  

I hope to find some time later this year to not only do fixes, but  
also work on new algorithms.  

Feel free to send links to working FeynCalc examples which might  
be of interest to others. If desired I could also add them to the
fcexamples directory.  

Enjoy,  
Rolf  

PS: Yes, Frederik, I know: I should use CVS. Will do this year ...
