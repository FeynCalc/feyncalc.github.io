Gentlemen,  

We have one of the new modules mis-named on the web page  
<http://www.feyncalc.org/frameset.html?=documentation/index.html>  

It is refered to as "tarver" and then several lines later as "tarcer".  

These simple errors do not engender confidence in a field where
mistakes  
lead to wrong conclusians.  

thank you,  

Jim Roller  

section follows:  

As of version 4.1, FeynCalc consists of a number of modules each related
to  
a certain area of quantum field theory (e.g. a physical model). A module
is  
a logical grouping of code, usually a package file or collection of
package  
files. Below follows a list of the present modules. The modules tarver
and  
phi are new modules that are being integrated into FeynCalc 4.1.  

FeynCalc modules:  

core (the file FeynCalc.m); definitions of the basic objects.  
fctools; tools for kinematics, algebraic manipulations, Feynman rules,  
Passarino-Veltmann decomposition of one-loop integrals and more.  
general; mathematical tools.  
qcd; QCD, gluon, OPE stuff and more.  
fctables; tables of integrals, splitting functions and more.  
tarcer; two loop stuff.  
Phi; ChPT stuf
