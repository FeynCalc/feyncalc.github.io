The formula you are referring to is valid only for SU(2), not for  
generic SU(N). Already  
for SU(3) it becomes invalid, since the result will contain products
of  
d^abc. SUNSimplify  
does not allow to specialize N, so only relations valid for SU(N) with  
arbitrary N can be employed. It is up to you to implement your own set  
of rules for specific N=2,3,...
