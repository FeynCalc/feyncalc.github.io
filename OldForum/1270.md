Hi again,  

and thanks for your prompt answer. Regarding the use of "." : I guess I
was mislead by reading in the documentation page for Contract :  

" The "." as multiplication operator is not necessary but just
convenient for typesetting.”  

Anyways I followed your suggestions but I still get an error message and
no result when calling  

In[64]:= DiracTrace[AmpF2, DiracTraceEvaluate -\> True, West
-\> True]  

During evaluation of In[64]:= DiracTrace::ndranomaly: You are
using naive dimensional regularization (NDR), such that in D dimensions
gamma^5 anticommutes with all other Dirac matrices. In this scheme
(without additional prescriptions) it is not possible to compute traces
with an odd number of gamma^5 unambiguously. Evaluation aborted\! \>\>  

Out[64]= $Aborted  

I have tried to set D-\>4 before or to use the option West-\> True, but
no luck so far.  

Thanks again for your help,  

Stefano
