In FeynCalc (like in FORM or Schoonship) there is in principle  
no distinction of contra- and covariant indices for gamma-matrices and
metric tensors.  
It is just the MakeBoxes-rules I once attached such that
DiracMatrix[mu]  
displays with a superscript. Internally it is just
DiracGamma[LorentzIndex[mu]] and contraction is
performed on repeated indices.  
Â   
Of course, with Levi-Civita tensors the story is different, but this  
is a different topic.  

If you are calculating scalar quantities, it does not matter where you
put indices (at least if you have Lorentz covariance...).
