UsePaVeBasis enters the stage only if the input contains  
tensor integrals. In your case there are none, so nothing  
happens.  

ToPaVe is applied to any output at the very end, hence, the  
conversion still occurs.  

There can be also cases where despite having  
UsePaVeBasis-\>True you will still get some scalar integrals  
as FADs, since those arose through partial fractioning before  
the actual tensor reduction.  

Using  

TID[amp,k1,UsePaVeBasis-\>True, ToPaVe-\>True]  

will ensure that all loop integrals in the output are always written  
as PaVe functions.  

Cheers,
