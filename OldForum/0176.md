Dear All,  

I am trying to use FeynCalc(PHI) & FeynArts to calculate amplitudes of
1  
loop self energies according to an extension of the SM that I am working
on.  
I can create the topologies insert and the fields just fine using
FeynsArts  
alone or embedded in FeynCalc so I am happy that the model file is
valid.  

However when I call CreateFCAmp it returns results that include terms
such  
as:  

Pair[6, Momentum[q1]] + Pair[7,
Momentum[q1]]  

I presume that this is somehow related to the Chiral projectors
Gamma6,  
Gamma7 but I am not sure how to interpret these terms. Should the  
calculations that follow still work or is the a bug in CreateFCAmp and
it's  
handling of the chiral projectors?  

Many thanks
