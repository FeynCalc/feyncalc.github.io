(MacBook Pro 10.6)  
For FeynArts run the scrip not as root.  
For FormCalc run the scrip not as root and put in the .profile  
export
MCC=/Applications/Mathematica.app/SystemFiles/Links/MathLink/DeveloperKit/CompilerAdditions/mcc  
Or what ever the mcc file exist (Not the mcc from MatLab but the
Mathematica's mcc).
