Hi,  
first of all I thank you for making available this extremely useful
package.  
I would like to report what could be a possible bug in the function
PaVeReduce in FeynCalc 9.2.0.  

If I try to PaVeReduce the function  
PaVe[1, 2, {0, s, 0}, {mf^2, mf^2, mf^2}]  
with FeynCalc 8.2.0 (I had it installed on my previous laptop) the
output is  
(mf^2\*PaVe[0, {0, 0, s}, {mf^2, mf^2, mf^2}])/s + 1/(2 s)  
while now with FeynCalc 9.2.0 I obtain just the first term  
(mf^2\*PaVe[0, {0, 0, s}, {mf^2, mf^2, mf^2}])/s  

I checked what should be the right answer by evaluating the three
expressions with LoopTools 2.13 (for mf-\>173, s-\>400), and I obtain
respectively  
\-1.39467\*10^-6  
\-1.39467\*10^-6  
\-0.00125139  
therefore the output of FC 8 seems to be the right one.  

Thanks for your help,  
Davide Racco
