Dear FeynCalc users,  

the FeynCalc website (https://feyncalc.github.io)  
now features a gallery of examples that were generated  
from the example .m files shipped with FeynCalc 9.3.  

You can have a look either by pressing the big "Example  
Gallery" button on the main page or directly via  

https://feyncalc.github.io/examples  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
