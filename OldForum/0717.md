Hello,  

I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m
working with loop integral involve terms like GS[p], and the
moment
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"p\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"
need to be put as zero. But I found something strange:  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
In[19]:= GS[p] /. p -\> 0  

Out[19]=
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[Gamma]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[CenterDot]0  
————————————————  

or you can see it more clearly using the StandardForm  
————————————————  
In[20]:= GS[p] /. p -\> 0 // StandardForm  

Out[20]//StandardForm= GS[0]  
————————————————  

The result should be zero though. It looks like FeynCalc or Mathematica
treat the GS[] as a function but without definition of
GS[0] =0.  

Furthermore, when the OneLoop involves the GS[0], it will become
GA[0]  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
In[22]:= OneLoop[p, GS[p] /. p -\> 0]  

Out[22]=
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[Gamma]^0  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  

Similar thing happens on the SPD[k,p], it will be zero when you
replace one of the moment to be zero, but  

In[30]:= Spinor[k, MT] SPD[k, p] /. p -\> 0 //  

Out[30]= 0
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[CurlyPhi](k,MT)  

or in StandardForm  
Out[31]= SPD[0, k] Spinor[Momentum[k], MT,
1]  

And this
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"
or SPD[0,k] will become GA[0].GA[0] after
applied the OneLoop function in my loop integral.  

Could you please look into this case?  
Thank you very much\!
