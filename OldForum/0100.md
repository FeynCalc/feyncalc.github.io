I am having trouble getting mathematica to install feyncalc. In response
to  
\<\<HighEnergyPhysics\`fc\`  
I get  
"Could not find FeynCalc installation  
Â Qutting the Mathematica kernel"  
Am using Mathematica 3.0.  
It looks like mathematica is at least reading fc.m, since it returns
"FeynCalc" in the error message.  
Any help would be appreciated.  
Jeff
