Hi,  
If there is a LeviCivita symbol in my Lagrangian, but it's all
contracted, (NO explicit index), do I need do anything special to take
care of it? Is it true that I only need to worry about upper/lower index
if I use LeviCivita symbol by explicit index? When I try to get the
Feynman Rule for what I am doing, I unexpectedly get zeros all the
time\!  

Thanks,  
My Phuong
