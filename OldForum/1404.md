Hi,  

I'm linking my question from Stack Exchange for clarity, since I can use
TeX formatting there:  

https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/171476/is-there-a-method-in-feyncalc-for-collecting-like-powers-of-four-vectors  

My problem concerns isolating like powers of some loop momentum in order
that a large integral may be broken down into a sum over smaller
integrals without using PV reduction. Is there any built-in method to do
this?  

Thanks in advance\!  

\-Matt
