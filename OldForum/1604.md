Dear Paulina,  

can you provide the squared amplitude (or a piece thereof)  
that generates this message? Essentially a minimal working example  
to understand what happens.  

$AL($188) is just a dummy index that is automatically introduced  
when squaring an amplitude to avoid violating Einstein's summing  
convention. That should not be an issue.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
