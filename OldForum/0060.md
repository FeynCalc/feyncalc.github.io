Dear Sir or Madam,  

Your FeynCalc is really useful for me to calculation. I had download
the  
FeynCalc v4.1 (HighEnergyPhysics-4.1.0.3b.zip). After installed I try to
run  
the  
command \<\<HighEnergyPhysics\`fc\`, but impossible, it give me the
following  
message:  

\==============================================================================

Could you please show me the way to run perfectly.  

Moreover, I would like to have the file HighEnergyPhysics-4.0. I think
this  
version is better (one 4.1.0.3beta). So please let me know the address
to  
download version 4.0.  

Thank you very much.  
Sincerely yours,  
N.T.Anh
