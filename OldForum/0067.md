Hi,  
no, in general no explicit representations are used.  
I only implemented rules like  
MetricTensor[mu,nu] MetricTensor[mu,nu] --\> 4  

For the Levi-Civita Tensor there is antisymmetry implemented and  
things like:  

In[6]:= SetOptions[Eps,Dimension-\>D];  

In[7]:= t=LCD[m,n,r,s]//FCI  

Out[7]= eps[m, n, r, s]  

In[8]:= %//InputForm  

Out[8]//InputForm=  
Eps[LorentzIndex[m, D], LorentzIndex[n, D],
LorentzIndex[r, D],  
Â LorentzIndex[s, D]]  

In[9]:= Contract[t t]//Factor2  

Out[9]= (1 - D) (2 - D) (3 - D) D  

    --
    The only exception is if you provide integer arguments to Eps, like:
    In[10]:= Eps[1,2,3,4]
    Out[10]= 1
    But this should not happen normally.
    --
    The only place where the metric comes into play is for one-loop calculations,
    and there in the convention for sign (  p^2 - m^2 )  in the 
    PropagatorDenominator function (and FeynAmpDenominator and alike).
    Maybe there are a few more random places where sign convention plays a role;
    but for normal contraction operations it is irrelevant since everything is 
    just algebra, no components used.
    Frederik might want to elaborate more on what conventions he uses in Phi.
