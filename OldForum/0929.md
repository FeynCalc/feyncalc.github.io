Hi Anne,  

thanks for you mail. There is indeed an issue that ToTFI  
is unable to do to the conversion because of q1+p (TARCER expects
q1-p).  
I'll fix it. For now you can just flip the sign of q1 by hand (which
is  
fine since it is a loop variable)  

Contract[fAmp // ChangeDimension[\#, D] \&] //
DiracSimplify //  
Â SPC[\#, q1, q2] &\`//ReplaceAll[\#,q1-\>-q2]//
ToTFI[\#, q1, q2, p] &  

I added ChangeDimension here, since the output of FeynArts is 4D.  
DiracSimplify and SPC are needed to simplify the Dirac algebra and  
cancel scalar products in the denominator.  

As a cross-check for TARCER I would recommend using Smirnov's FIRE  
(https://bitbucket.org/feynmanIntegrals/fire)  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
