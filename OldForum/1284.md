Dear FeynCalc team,  

I'm a postdoc in High energy physics in Chile. When using FeynCalc, I'm
finding an issue that I would like to discuss with you. It would be
helpful if you give me some email address so that I can send you the .nb
notebook with the issue in question.  

Thank you very much in advance,  
Best regards,  

Juan Carlos  

p.s. Sorry I forgot to include my email address in my previous
message.
