There is no bug here I think.  
If you set  

SetOptions[SUNSimplify,SUNNToCACF-\>False]  

you get then (switchin on InputForm with FI; ) :  

In[14]:= FI; SUNDelta[i,i]//SUNSimplify  

Out[14]= -1 + SUNN^2  

(\* as it should be \*)  

In[15]:= ?SUNN  
SUNN denotes the number of colors.  
Trick[SUNDelta[a, a]] yields (SUNN^2 -1).
