Hi,  

I think that the problem comes from the wrong summation over the  
polarizations of the gauge fields.  

You do know, how one correctly sums over the polarizations of a
massless  
vector boson including the choice of an auxiliary vector (c.f. e.g.
the  
appendix A.1.1.6 of Boehm Denner and Joos, "Gauge Theories of the
Strong  
and Electroweak Interaction")  

The replacement eps^mu eps^\*nu -\> - g^{mu nu} which corresponds to  
DoPolarizationSums[exp, k, 0] is valid only in QED, where the  
Ward-Identities ensure that cancellation of the unphysical degrees of  
freedom. In QCD this replacement alone already does not work, unless
one  
adds extra diagrams with external ghost-fields.  

Since you added unphysical longitudinal on-shell degrees of freedom to  
you matrix element squared, no wonder that the unitarity is violated.  

How about this:  

ms = FermionSpinSum[f fstar] /. DiracTrace -\> TR // Contract
//  
    Simplify;  
msquaredneutral =  
  DoPolarizationSums[DoPolarizationSums[ms, k2, p2], p2,
k2] // Simplify  
Plot[msquaredneutral /. {mp -\> 1, p -\> 2}, {\\[Theta], 0,
Pi}]  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
