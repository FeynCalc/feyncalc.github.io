hi,  
I tried to install the feyncalc package on my notebook running
mathematica 5.2 under winxpsp2. after extracting fc5beta2.zip to the
folder c:\\programme\\Wolfram
Research\\Mathematica\\5.2\\AddOns\\Applications and rebuilding the help
index feyncalc asks me to install feynarts first. But after unzipping
FeynArts32.tar.gz into the ...AddOns\\Applications\\HighEnergyPhysics
folder, feyncalc still claims that feynarts is not installed. I tried
putting the feynarts package in ...\\AddOns\\Applications, no result. Am
I missing something here? Any help is very much appreciated.  
Regards, Maurits
