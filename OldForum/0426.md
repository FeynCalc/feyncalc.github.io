Thanks for your work Rolf, now FeynCalc seems to work fine with
Mathematica 6.  
So far I only found a tiny error which appears the first time I execute
the "Calc" command:  

Global\`OverVector::shdw: "Symbol OverVector appears in multiple
contexts Global\`,System\`; definitions in context Global\` may shadow
or be shadowed by other definitions."  

Another issue is: How can I access the documentation from within
Mathematica 6 (F1-help on function etc.)?
