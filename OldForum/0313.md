Hi Rolf,  

I guess you recieved my email with the notebook file. As you said you
are busy and probably didn't find time to check.  

I just wanted to update you what I did after that. Obviously I got more
experience with FeynCalc by playing with FeynCalc even though I was
supposed to finish a messy calculation:)  
In addition to the simplifications I did to the matrix elements before
using OneLoop, I also am using mathematica in batch mode and this helped
as well to do the calculation faster but still not the best.  

However, while I was looking the output from, after OneLoop routine, one
of the matrix element in the notebook(that I called WSelfonglnC1), I
realized that there are vectors having a dummy index called
$mud[2], more specificially of the form
FV[Polarization[k2, I],  
     HighEnergyPhysics\`fctools\`OneLoop\`Private\`mud[2]].
Of course nothing is wrong with that as long as the whole term is scalar
which must be the case since I also included two polarization vectors
for the final state gluons. But, Such terms has factors carrying NO such
free index $mud[2]\!\!  

This cannot be the case since we started from a Lorentz scalar matrix
element and ended up after loop integration with some terms having a
free index $mud[2] which is supposed to be dummy by definition.
I am pretty sure that OneLoop does some wrong things especially at the
stage extracting loop momentum dependent terms from scalar products.  

The solution that I found to this is NOT to include two polarization
vectors of the gluons at the first place and leave the matrix a second
rank tensor and see what I am getting from the loop integration.
Interestingly enough, this time I am getting something which at least
has NO such obviously problematic terms.  

So, there might be a problem for OneLoop in handling the polarization
vectors when they are contracted with especially the momentum over which
the loop integration is going to be carried out.  

Sorry about such a long email.  

Thank a lot for your time,  
Best Regards,  
Ismail
