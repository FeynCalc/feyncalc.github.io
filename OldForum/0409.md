Dear all,  

I am user of FeynArts et FormCalc packages since 4 years agoe, and when
I installed the new vesion of FeynCalc, the execution of FeynArts is
done, and the following messages are showing:  

FeynArts 3.2  
by Hagen Eck, Sepp Kublbeck, and Thomas Hahn  
last revised 27 Mar 06  
patched for use with FeynCalc by Frederik Orellana and Rolf Mertig  

SetOptions:: optnf: FeynCalcIntenal is not known option for FourVector  
SetOptions:: optnf: FeynCalcIntenal is not known option for
MetricTensor  
SetOptions:: optnf: FeynCalcIntenal is not known option for DiracSlash  

General::stop: Further ouptput of SetOptions::optnf  
will be suppressed during this calculation  

Please can you help me to correct this problem  
Thank you very much
