Dear Rolf, thanks very much for your qiuck reply.  

Sorry, I mean it used several miniutes to run the code with
HighEnergyPhysics-4.2.0pre1.tar on Mathematica 5.2, while for the
feyncalc600.zip on Mathematica 6.0, the time was more than half an hour,
and so is the case with fc5beta3.tar.gz on Mathematica 5.2?  

And I mean, the Tr seems much faster in FC4.2 than the later versions,
does it?
