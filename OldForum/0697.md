Hi,  

I have a pretty large matrix element with stuff like:  

SP[p1, e3]\*SP[p2, e4]\*SP[e1, e2] \*...  

M^2 has polarization sums, for which I want to apply the rule. First I
uncontract my M^2:  

Uncontract[Expand[M^2], e3, e1, e2, e4, p1, p2, p3, p4, Pair
-\> All,  
 Unique -\> False]  

Now I have a lot of dummy indices. I want to define the polarization
rule, like:  

constraint =  
 FeynCalcInternal[  
  FourVector[e1, mu] FourVector[e1, nu] -\>  
   PolarizationSum[mu, nu, p1]]  

But I have to specify indices (mu and nu in this case). Unfortunately, I
don't know the names, because the dummy indices get automatically
assigned. This auto-assigning is very useful, because I have a lot of
dot products, so giving them an index manually is too much work.  

Can I define a generic index, like e1(mu?)\*e1(nu?), as is possible in
Form?
