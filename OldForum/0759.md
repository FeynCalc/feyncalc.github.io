Hi,  

I have a very simple question.  

I compute the scalar product of two vectors p1 and p2, but each of them
multiplied by Reals a, b :  
Â i.e. SP[a p1, b p2]  
I expect (a\*b p1.p2) but I get (a p1).(b p2)  
How do I tell FeynCalc that a,b are to be treated as Reals?  

Explicitly doing SP[3 p1, 4 p2] gives me 12 p1.p2 as expected.  

Thanks for any help.
