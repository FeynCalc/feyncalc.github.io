Hi,  

sorry for the late reply. I'm afraid that I'm not aware of a good  
cookbook recipe for working out such counter-terms in arbitrary
theories.  

The standard papers for the Breitenlohner-Maison-t'Hooft-Veltman  
prescription of treating gamma^5 in DR are the works of Bonneau  
(linear sigma model)  

https://inspirehep.net/record/155960  
https://inspirehep.net/record/155959  

Larin (QCD)  

hep-ph/9302240  

and Martin & Sanchez-Ruiz (a generic chiral non-Abelian theory):  

arXiv:hep-th/9905076  

One can also find some discussion in Collins' Renormalization, chapter
13.  

Unfortunately all these references are rather technical :(  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
