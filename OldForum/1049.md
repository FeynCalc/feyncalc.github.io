Hi,  

I'm using the Feynarts 3.9 with the FeynCalc 9.0 (I also tested with
development version) and I'm getting a problem to use the unitary gauge
with the FCFAConvert.  

I'm using: Model -\> {"SM", "UnitarySM"}, GenericModel -\> {"Lorentz",  
  "UnitaryLorentz"}  

 and setting the unitary gauge in the following way:  

FCFAConvert[  
 CreateFeynAmp[dias, Truncated -\> False,  
  GaugeRules -\> {GaugeXi[Z] -\> Infinity, GaugeXi[A]
-\> Infinity,  
    GaugeXi[W] -\> Infinity}],  
 IncomingMomenta -\> {p1, p2}, OutgoingMomenta -\> {k1, k2},  
 UndoChiralSplittings -\> True, ChangeDimension -\> 4, List -\>
False]  

In the end the amplitude still depends on \\xi\_Z. I'm doing something
wrong or this could be a bug?  

Thank you very much\!
