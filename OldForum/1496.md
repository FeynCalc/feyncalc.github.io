Since it is not very likely that someone here might help you  
(personally, I'm not very familiar with FeynRules and its internal  
working), I would address this question to the FeynRules developers.  

Cheers,

have loaded it in the mathematica session with no problem, the
lagrangian and the vertices which FeynRules derives in terms of weyl
spinors seem OK. But in order to use the model for FeynArts and FeynCalc
I have to convert to dirac notation.I use the command
Ld=WeyltoDirac["lagrangian"] to do it but when FeynRules
calculates vertices for Ld all the vertices including fermions are
omitted.I do not have any idea where the problem comes from.Would you
please help me about this?Thanks in advance.*
