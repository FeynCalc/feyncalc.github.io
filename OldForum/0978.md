This is what TensorFunction is for  

TH[x\_, y\_] := TensorFunction[{Theta, "A"}, x, y]  

TH[a, b] + TH[b, a]  

gives 0. Same for  

Contract[TH[a, b] MT[a, b]]  

or  

Contract[TH[a, b] FV[p, a] FV[p, b]]  

For  

Contract[TH[a, b] FV[p, a] FV[q, b] -
TH[a, b] FV[p, b] FV[q, a]]  

you get 2 Theta[Momentum[p], Momentum[q]]  

The only inconvenience is that a contraction of an antisymmetric
tensor  
with a symmetric one doesn't vanish automatically.

*\> Dear All*  
*\>*  
*\> I am doing one scattering calculation by trace method. I need to
define two index antisymmetric Lorentz tensor(\\theta\_{\\mu \\nu}.
where \\mu,\\nu..1..4) in my code.*  
*\>*  
*\> I am not able to figure out how one can do it in feyncalc...Please
help\!\!*
