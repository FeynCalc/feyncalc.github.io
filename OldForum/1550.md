Hi Cristian,  

the mistake seems to be in  

SPD[p, p] == pp;  

which should be  

SPD[p, p] = pp;  

The first code is just an equation (i.e. does nothing),  
while the second assigns SPD[p,p] the value pp.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav

as in your example on arXiv and I still get the same issue. I was using
FeynCalc 9.2 when I found this problem so I decided to try with the 9.3
version but the problem remained. You can find the Mathematica code I am
using in the following GitHub link:*
