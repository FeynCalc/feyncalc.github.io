Hi,  
you can get a result without $MU's by doing:  

DiracEquation[  
  DotExpand[  
    DiracGammaExpand[  
      Expand[Contract[DotExpand[Contract[MomentumCombine2[Contract[M]]]]]]]]]  

However, the result can be simplified by renaming  
the indices ( c \<--\> d ), as you would do by hand.  

That is what I have automatized (which was actually quite non-trivial,
especially if there are higher tensors involced) in DiracSimplify (which
is used in Calc), and the dummy indices generated are called
$MU[...] .
