Hmm, I must admit that I'm not even able to reproduce your problem.  
On my Mathematica 9 the ordering always remains the same, no matter  
if FeynCalc is loaded or not.  

Apart from that, FeynCalc doesn't modify properties of Ordering and it  
is definitely \*not\* supposed to change the ordering of the terms in
the  
front end.  

Could you provide some more details?  

Cheers,
