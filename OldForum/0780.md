As Rolf correctly noticed, FeynCalc already offers routines for doing  
tensor decompositions, so that there is actually no need to do it by
hand.  

Coming back to your particular example, there are two reasons why the  
replacement doesn't work  

1\) The results returned by the FeynCalc functions are in the FeynCalc  
internal representation, while your replacement rules uses the
FeynCalc  
external representation. To switch between the two use FCE and FCI  

<http://www.feyncalc.org/FeynCalcBook/FCE/>  
<http://www.feyncalc.org/FeynCalcBook/FCI/>  

2\) FeynCalc uses Dot operator to handle non-commutative objects like  
Dirac or color matrices. So  
GSD[k].GSD[l] actually means
Dot[GSD[k],GSD[l]]  

So the correct replacement rule is  

s5 = FCE[ss4] /. {Dot[a\_\_\_, GSD[l], b\_\_\_]
SPD[l, q] -\>  
    Dot[a, GSD[q], b] SPD[l, l]/D}  

But again, I would rather recommend using FeynCalc routines for this  
kind of things  

Cheers,
