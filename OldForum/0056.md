hi  
i am a PhD student in physics at Boston College,in the USA.  
I heard about the package for mathematica and i am thinking of using
it  
for my calculations,so I was wondering if the package works also for  
condensed matter theory.  
If it does,do i have to bring any modification at the source file or
is  
there a way to skip the problem anyhow?  
looking forward to your reply,  
best regards
