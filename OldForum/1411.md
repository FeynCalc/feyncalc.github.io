I've been trying to run an example of Chiral perturbation theory  
calculation. The notebook is from the PHI examples website  
(<http://www.feyncalc.org/phi/examples>). The notebook is titled  
PiN.nb. Every time I run the notebook, the "InsertFields" command  
throws up an error the says  

loading generic model file $Failed  
Get: $Failed is not a string, SocketObject, InputStream[], or
OutputStream[].  
$Aborted  

I've tried changing "Nucleon[0,j1]" etc to
"Nucleon[0,{j1}]" etc. I've also tried removing
"Model-\>"Automatic",GenericModel-\>"Automatic"".  
Please help\!  

Specifications:  
Raspberry Pi B running Raspbian 8.0 (jessie)  
Mathematica v11.0.1.0  
FeynCalc v9.2.0  
FeynArts v3.9  
PHI v1.3
