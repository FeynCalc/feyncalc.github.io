Dear Developer,  

Hello,  

In the use of SUND, I was aware that the formula for the reduction of
the triple product of symmetric tensors  
d\_{iab} d\_{jbc} d\_{kca} = (N/2 - 6/N) d\_{ijk}  
and  
that for the quadruple product  
d\_{iab} d\_{jbc} d\_{kcd} d\_{lda} = ( 1 - 4/N^2 ) (delta\_{ij}
delta\_{kl} +delta\_{il} delta\_{jk} ) + ( N/4 - 4/N )( d\_{ijr}
d\_{klr} + d\_{ilr} d\_{jkr} ) - ( N/4 ) d\_{ikr} d\_{jlr}  
are lacking.  
(d\_{ijk} is the symmetric tensor SUND[i,j,k] and delta\_{ij}
the Kronecker delta symbol).  
Is it possible to add them in the formula of FeynCalc so that
SUNSimplify can also reduce expressions involving them?  

Sincerely yours,  

Nodoka Yamanaka.
