I'm trying to calculate spence functions in Mathematica 7, but
Mathematica gives me strange infinities. Can I use LoopTools to directly
calculate Spence functions? eg. not directly calculate C0, but instead
just evaluate a given spence function? If not, is there documentation on
the routine that LoopTools uses to calculate Spence functions? I've not
managed to find anything the the FF manual.  

Many Thanks for your help,
