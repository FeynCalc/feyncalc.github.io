There is nothing special about gamma matrices in FeynCalc. The  
thing is just that ComplexConjugate is meant to be applied on only  
closed spinor chains, i.e. expressions of type ubar.(gamma matrices).v  
that usually appear in a matrix element and not on single gamma
matrices.  

The two examples you quoted make perfect sense if you consider that  
GA[5] and GA[i] are inside a closed spinor chain. For
example  

(ubar.g^5.v)\* = (u^\*\_i g^0\_ij g^5\_jk v\_k)\* =  
u\_i g^(0\*)\_ij g^(5\*)\_jk v^\*\_k  

since g^0 is hermitian, i.e.  
(g^0\_ij)\* = g^(0 \\dagger)\_ji = g^0\_ji  

we get  

(ubar.g^5.v)\* = v^\*\_k g^(5 \\dagger)\_kj g^0\_ji u\_i =  

\- v^\*\_k g^0\_kl g^5\_lm g^0\_mj g^0\_ji u\_i =  
\- v^\*\_k g^0\_kl g^5\_li u\_i = - (vbar.g^5.u)  

where I used that g^5\\dagger = - g^0 g^5 g^0.

*\> Hi,*  
*\> How are gamma matrices defined in Feyncalc?*  
*\> Becouse in a standard definition (the one by wikipedia for example)
we have*  
*\> ComplexConjugate[GA[5]]=GA[5] and
ComplexConjugate[GA[i]]=GA[0]GA[i]GA[0]
,i=0,1,2,3.*  
*\>*  
*\> whereas in Feyncalc*  
*\> ComplexConjugate[GA[5]]=-GA[5] and
ComplexConjugate[GA[i]]=GA[i].*
