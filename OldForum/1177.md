res = PaXEvaluate[B0[pp, 0, 0]]  

res // StandardForm  

2 + 1/Epsilon - EulerGamma + Log[-(ScaleMu^2/(\\[Pi]
pp))]  

Cheers,

*\> I have used OneLoop function, the result is expressed involving
B0[pp,0,0].*  
*\> I know B0 is the scalar integral of Passarino-Veltman reduction, but
I wonder can also B0 be reduced to some explicit form, just like terms
of log, gamma(Eulers constant) such that?*

*\> Are there some useful function to deal with two-loop amplitudes?*
