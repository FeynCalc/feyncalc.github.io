Hi Kyrylo,  

thanks for pointing this out and for testing the development version.  
There was a problem with the Contract option for massive vector
bosons,  
such that the polarization sum didn't evaluate unless the option  
Contract was set to False (default is True). This is now corrected  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/commit/d3783e2d5dc692386befd2b45a70d4d417c13ec7\>  

and DoPolarizationSums[tmp + 1, p] returns  

3 - Pair[LorentzIndex[mu], LorentzIndex[nu]] +
(  
  Pair[LorentzIndex[mu], Momentum[p]]
Pair[LorentzIndex[nu],  
    Momentum[p]])/Pair[Momentum[p],
Momentum[p]]  

*\> 2) DoPolarizationSums[tmp+1,p,0] gives*

The "4" comes from the fact that with this command you're replacing  
Sum\_{la=1,2} eps\*^mu(p,la) eps^nu(p,la) by the so called  
"pseudo-completeness relation" i.e.  
Sum\_{la=0,1,2,3} g\_{lambda,lambda} eps\*^mu(p,lambda)
eps^nu(p,lambda)  
which equals - g^{mu,nu}.But if there are no polarization vectors in
the  
expression, then "Sum\_{la=0,1,2,3}" gives you 4.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
