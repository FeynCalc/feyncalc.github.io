Hello,  

I am using Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS and Mathematica 8.0.4.0.  
As suggested, I deleted the Feyncalc folder inside the Mathematica
installation folder, tried to install again using the mentioned
command  

*\>
Import["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/master/install.m"]*  
*\> InstallFeynCalc[InstallFeynCalcDevelopmentVersion -\>
True]*  

but still obtaining the same error message (as said, the evaluation is
correct despite of the message).  

Is it the code above for the installation correct? Maybe it is the
Mathematica version, I will try to see if I could use a newer one in
someone else's computer or Uni server.  

Thanks for your help
