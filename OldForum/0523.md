I am very badly in need of solvin the following problem.  
I have combination of spinor chains in the amplitude with structures
like e.g.  
1)[(Spinor[P/2+-q,M].\_\_\_.
Spinor[P/2-+q],M)\*(Spinor[k1,M].\_\_\_\_.Spinor[k2,M])]  

2\) [(Spinor[P/2+-q,M].\_\_\_.
Spinor[anyk,M])\*(Spinor[P/2-+q,M].\_\_\_\_.Spinor[anyk,M])]  

(Note that M is same in all)  
I have a large number of diagrams. Now I want to read these chains
like:  

Spinor[anyk,M].\_\_\_.Spinor[anyk,M]  
Spinor[P/2+-q,M].\_\_\_.Spinor[P/2-+q,M]  
Spinor[P/2+-q,M].\_\_\_.Spinor[anyk,M] or vice versa  

I have successfully separated out the 1st chain
(Spinor[anyk,M].\_\_\_.Spinor[anyk,M]) but my if loop is
not working for the rest of two.What I wrote is:  

If[FreeQ[chain22[i1,i2,i5],Xor[Spinor[a\_+b\_,MC,\_\_\_],Spinor[a\_-b\_,MC,\_\_\_]]],  
{condition1},{condition2}]  

I mean Xor is true if the chain contains odd number of
Spinor[P/2+-q,M].  

Help out please..........
