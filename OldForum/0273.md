In order to speed up the installation process of the latest version of
PHI so that novices like me can  
get an idea of how the software works. I found out that the Moeller
Notebooks and QED examples  
only work if the test version of FeynCalc 4.2 is linked with FeynArts
3.1  

Hope this helps anyone out there
