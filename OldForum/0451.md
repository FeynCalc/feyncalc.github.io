Hi,  

I am thinking to derive the complete list of Feynman rules for a
supersymmetric model by starting from a textbook level Lagrangian.
FeynCalc has some functions like PartialD, CovariantD, FeynRule, etc..
for defining Lagrangian and then deriving Feynman rules. It seems that
it is quite powerful if one needs few Feynman rules to extract but I am
not sure how handy it is if the full list is required. Practically, if
there are vast number of fields in the model like MSSM, the number of
possible interactions get so large such that checking them one by one
with FeynRule seems a bit hard(one can easily forget some allowed
interactions).  

My question is: How manageable is the generation of the full list of
Feynman rules from a textbook level Lagrangian of a model when
especially supersymmetry is switched on(like MSSM)?  
If possible, is there an easy and convenient way to take care of
H.c.(Hermitian Conjugated) part of the Lagrangian?  

Thank you very much in advance,  

Regards,  
Ismail
