The question is quite old, but I guess there's no harm answering it.  

The only collection of simple examples for using FormCalc (apart from  
the EW calculations supplied with the software itself) I'm aware of
are  
these lectures by Sho Iwamoto:  

\<<http://en.misho-web.com/phys/feynlecture.html>\>  

I also attach my solution (despite my very basic FormCalc skills) for  
Lecture1-ex.nb (QCD tree level 2-\>2 parton processes), may be that
could  
be helpful as well.  

Apart from that, if you have higher level questions or are interested
in  
some additional features, you can always contact Thomas directly.  
Sometimes he needs more time to reply (especially if he is on a  
conference etc.) but so far I always got from him very friendly
answers  
to all my questions.  

Ok, enough off-topic. After all we are here on the \*FeynCalc\*
mailing  
list ;)  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav

FeynArts and FormCalc.*
