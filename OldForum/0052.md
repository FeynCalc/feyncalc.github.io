Well, I wouldn't call it a bug...  
FeynCalcExternal translates
Eps[LorentzIndex[l1],...,Momentum[p1],...] into
LC[l1,...][p1,...].  
For this to make sense, the arguments to Eps must be a list of Lorentz
indices followed by alist of momenta, not vice versa and not mixed. This
can be achieved e.g. with Calc.  

All in all, a matter of notation.  

Best wishes, Frederik Orellana
