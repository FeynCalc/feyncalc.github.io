Hi there.  

Are you loading Phi ?  

If so, well, it actually does work but you get some warnings because
I've  
specified some stupid formatting rules for QuantumField. These have to
do  
only with how things are displayed in TraditionalForm. I'll fix it
asap.  

The point is that I always use a sort of more complicated notation,
e.g.  

QuantumField[Particle[f], { }, {i}]  

which displays without any warnings.  

In any case, if you do  

QuantumField[f,{ }, {i}]//StandardForm  

you'll get  

QuantumField[f,SUNIndex[i]]  

Cheers, Frederik
