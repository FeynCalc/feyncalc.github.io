hello, this is my first post here,  
i am new to feyncalc  
i want to write a program using feyncalc that evaluate the cross-section
of a process (say, moller or bhabha) begining form the amplitude until
the cross-section.  
i used FermiuonSpinSum and i gor many errors and unwanted results.  
please give me a .m file that do this .
