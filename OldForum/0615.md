Hi all  
i need to know how i can square the amplitude of any decay  
by using feyncalc or any program else  
note that my formula which i get it from inserting the amplitude  
in feyncalc program include some scalar functions  
as (B\_0, C\_0, C\_1, C\_2, C\_11, C\_12, ...)  
these functions that i can't square them  
if any one can help me and tell me the command which i can use  
it to solve my problem or any other solution, i will be so happy  
and thankful for him or her.  
my operatring system is Linux and i use mathematica 6.2 and  
feyncalc 6.0  
thanks  
Hayam
