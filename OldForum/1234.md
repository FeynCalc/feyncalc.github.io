If you installed the development version yesterday before 20.00
(German  
time), it might be because I forgot to add an important file to my
commit.  

So I would suggest that you try to reinstall and see if the problem  
persists. I tested it just now, and there seem to be no issues with  

Contract[LC[mu, nu, rho, sigma] FV[k, mu] FV[P,
rho]]  

Cheers,
