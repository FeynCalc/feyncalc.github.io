curiously, the clifford package emerged out of the mind of Rafal whene  
refereeing a paper based on extensive mathematica computations. Since
he  
had no chance to recalculate or understand, he programed a set of
maple  
(just that was on his computer) routines to check the claims (which
were  
found true by teh way), having the code, and the effort done, he
embarked  
to compleete the functionality, by now, over 120 functions and over
750  
pasges of documentation shipping with the package, where you will find  
even unpublished math, so I hope for such a future for AXIOM, but as
you  
mention it needs to be portable on the basis of peopel not program
code.
