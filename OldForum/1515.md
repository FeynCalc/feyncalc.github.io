Dear Vladyslav,  

I am back using FeynCalc after several years. I installed the stable  
version following the instructions of the github website (automatic  
intallation). This version is numbered as 9.2.0. I can run my old codes,
fine.  
Still, I wanted to get through a few examples as provided in the same  
website, just to refresh a little bit, and to learn tricks. When trying
to  
runthem, I see that it is assumed that at least the version 9.3 is
installed.  
Therefore I am a bit lost: are these example prepared using a version  
which is still under development?  

Thanks in advance  

Best  

Samuel
