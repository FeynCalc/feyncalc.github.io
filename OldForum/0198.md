Hi,  

as fare as I understand the package (havn't though done much with it, so
I  
might be wrong), it is designed for very "practical" purpose (ie  
phenomenology.) Many problems can be subsummarized in a larger frame
of  
mathematics. Given the type system of AXIOM, it would be, in my eyes,
a  
fraud to implement something like "Dirac matrixes" and trace rules,
while  
this is a closed structure in a \*-autonomous category. However, I am
still  
not able myself to give AXIOM code for such a vast general thing.  

Most CAS do \_not\_ document actual algorithms. Its even very difficult
(as  
a non expert)= to find/lookup the currently favored algorithms (for
say  
comparison with own better(?) ones). So I consider the pamphlet idea to
be  
one of the most important of AXIOM and would support a FeynCalc
package  
iff its really \_fully\_ documented via pamphlet format \_including\_
all  
algorithmical details.  

ciao  
BF.
