Dear Sir:  
   I am an user of FenCalc for two years. Recently I find a surprsing(to
me) properties of some codes. Following are the codes:  
\--------------  
OneLoop[k,ScalarProduct[k,p1]^2ScalarProduct[k,p2]ScalarProduct[k,p1]FAD
[{k,M1},{k-p2},{k-p4},{p1+p2-k,M2}],OneLoopSimplify-\>True];  
\--------------  
With this code, I can get results when using math4.1+FeynCalc4.1.1  
but some mistakes (FYI..) are reported when I use maht5.1+FeynCalc5beta3
or 5beta1 or 4.2;  
I want to know whether there are some bug in OneLoopSimplify in some
cases. Would you kindly like to give me some informations on this.
