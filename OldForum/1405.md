Hi,  

I'm not sure that I exactly understand what you are trying to achieve,  
so an explicit example (preferably in the FeynCalc notation) would be  
helpful.  

Did you already have a look at various FCLoop\* functions, cf. Section  
3.4 of arXiv:1601.01167 ?  

exp = FVD[q1 + l, mu] FVD[q2 + l, nu] FVD[l,  
     rho] FAD[{l}, {l + q1}, {l + q2}];  

FCLoopIsolate[exp // ExpandScalarProduct, {l}]  

I'm also not sure that I understand what are tensor integrals that  
cannot be handled using tensor reduction.  

As long as your integrals depend on some 4-momenta (loop and
external),  
like f(q\_i,l\_i), it should be possible to use the Tdec function and  
generate the tensor basis, independently of what f(q\_i,l\_i) looks
like.  

For example, in my PhD thesis I used Tdec to do tensor reduction on  
nonrelativistic Cartesian integrals and that worked flawlessly (albeit  
with some amount of extra code).  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
