Hi Jack,  

I'm afraid, you're a bit off-topic with FormCalc questions on this  
mailing list, since it is actually devoted to a different program  
(FeynCalc), see here:  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/wiki/FAQ\#fcfc\>  

Although I generally don't mind answering non-FeynCalc related  
questions, this is one is beyond my abilities. In particular, because  
presently I don't have a Windows machine with Mathematica and cygwin
at  
hand.  

I would suggest that you write an e-mail directly to Thomas:  
\<[hahn_at_HIDDEN-E-MAIL]\>.
This should be the fastest way to fix your problem.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav  

The "FormCalc\`Private\`"  
parts really should not appear in the FORM files
