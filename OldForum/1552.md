In FeynCalc-9.3, I read "BMHV is algebraically consistent but often
suffers from nonconservation of currents in the final results. The
conservation must be then enfornced by introducing finite counter-terms.
The counter-terms are to be supplied by the user, since FeynCalc does
not do this automatically".  
I want to know under what circumstances we need to introduce finite
counter-terms.  
And when I calculate Charged Higgs decay into W boson and Z boson in the
2HDM model at two loop level, Do I need to add some finite counter-terms
by hand?
