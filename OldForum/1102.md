Hi everyone\!  
The model I am using is the following  

.mod file <http://pastebin.com/JiTtUxRV>  
.gen file <http://pastebin.com/4zTsR70j>  

where there is a spin-1 and spin-2 fields which couple to d-type quark.
The theory is SU(3) flavor-invariant and I have operators with the
expression of the generators.  
I tried to define them in feynrules and then export the model. Any way,
I replaced them with FASUNT and it seems to work well.  

When i ask to compare the amplitude for the process dq dq -\> dq dq
with  
InsertFields[top, {F[4, {}], F[4, {}]} -\> {F[4,
{}], F[4, {}]},  
  InsertionLevel -\> {Classes}, Model -\> "spin2",  
  GenericModel -\> "spin2",  
  ExcludeParticles -\> {S[2], V[1], V[2],
S[1], V[3], S[3]}];  

 I get the result without problem.  

Instead, when I try to compute the amplitude for a specific generation
of quarks, like d d -\> d d I get the a strange result

It seems that the sum over the adjoint-generation indices (the index
labeling the generators) does not work… any suggestion??  

Thank you,  
Francesco
