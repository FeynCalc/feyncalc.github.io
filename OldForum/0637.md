This is not a bug.  
In four dimensions the difference is zero, by use of the Schouten
identity.  
That R4 is not zero in D dimensions is a consequence of the way the
trace is calculated. This is in general dependent on the
"gamma5-prescription". It is up to the user to determine how to do these
kind of traces (e.g., by determining where to put gamma5 in Tr, this can
be hairy and you might have to worry about anomalies etc.).
