Thank you for your prompt answer\!  

The correction solved the problem for that piece, but it seems that it's
not enough for  

amp = DiracGamma[Momentum[z, D], D].GA5
FeynAmpDenominator[  
   PropagatorDenominator[Momentum[z, D], M],  
   PropagatorDenominator[Momentum[k, D] + Momentum[z,
D], M],  
   PropagatorDenominator[-Momentum[k, D] + Momentum[pp,
D] -  
     Momentum[z, D], MD],  
   PropagatorDenominator[Momentum[p, D] - Momentum[z,
D], m]] Pair[  
   Momentum[k, D], Momentum[z, D]]  

TID[amp, z]  

This is related to the previous one with an extra GA5. I checked your
change of TID.m with the additional  

t0 = DiracGammaExpand[t0]  

and it seems that the expansion is not really complete in this case.  
Taking instead  

t0 = DiracGammaExpand[t0]//DiracSimplify  

seems to solve the problem, at least for this particular case.  

best regards
