 Dear Developers,  

   Suppose I have some expression made of multy-index fields (e.g.
Lagrangian)  
  I want to substitute an explicit array of fields instead of one field
index  
(e.g. A\_i = {A\_1,A\_2,A\_3} )  
  I want to get proper sums at the places where removed index was
contracted.  
   Are there ways to do it?  

  Thank you for help,  
         Sergey.
