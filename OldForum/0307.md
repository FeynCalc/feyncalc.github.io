Dear Rolf,  

I have recently started using FeynCalc and found it very useful for the
first place. However, as I tried to compute one self energy diagram with
3 or 4 external legs(two fermion 2 gluon), I didn't get a result for
cases with denominator FAD[{q, m1}]QP[{p + q -
k,m2}]=I/((q^2-m1^2)((p+q-k)^2-m2^2)). This is basically B0-type
function. Instead if I have FAD[{q, m1}]QP[{p + q, m2}]
type of denominator, then I would get an compact answer in a resonable
time. I don't believe that the program couldn't handle the first but the
second. I am using OneLoopSimplify-\>True setting for OneLoop[]
command.  

Any help, suggestion is greatly appreciated.  

Ismail  

PS:I am using MAthematica 4.0 in Windows 2000 enviroment. I preferred to
install FeynCalc 5.1 beta2 which I assumed that it would work with
mathematica 4.0 as well. Could this lead to some problems?
