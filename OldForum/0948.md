Hi,  

first of all, you'll obtain the same result if you do this calculation  
with pen and paper.  

*\>From the contraction of the two epsilon tensors you get*  

2 g^{c,f} g^{d,e} - 2 g^{c,e} g^{d,f}  

Now in the first term two polarization vectors get contracted with
each  
other:  

eps(w,la)^d eps\*(w,la)^\*e g^{d,e} = -1  

which is the standard normalization. Hence, in the first term there
are  
no polarization vectors left.  

Now, from the physical point of view, this "discrepancy" is not  
surprising, as the polarization sum is by definition a gauge dependent  
quantity, i.e. it is not physical. On the other hand, the matrix
element  
squared, where this sum enters, is a physical quantity and there it is  
guaranteed that the gauge dependent terms involving the auxiliary
vector  
n^mu will cancel.  

So I would suggest that you consider the full matrix element from
which  
you get your bla expression and check there if this difference between  
bla and Contract[bla] changes the physical result, which it
shouldn't.  

P.S. By the way, one can see nicely see how the gauge dependent terms  
cancel out in the gg-\>gg example (QCDGGToGGTree.m) included in the  
development version of FeynCalc.  

If you replace  

ClearAll[pre];  
Table[Print[" calculating product of the amplitudes ", i, " and
",  
j," (CC), time = ",
Timing[pre[i,j]=re[i,j]//polsums[\#,k1,k2,  
1/2]&//polsums[\#,k2,k1,1/2]&//polsums[\#,k3,k4,1]&//polsums[\#,k4,k3,1]&//Simplify][[1]]];pre[i,j],{i,4},{j,i}];  

with  

ClearAll[pre];  
Table[Print[" calculating product of the amplitudes ", i, " and
",  
j," (CC), time = ",
Timing[pre[i,j]=re[i,j]//polsums[\#,k1,4k2+k3,  
1/2]&//polsums[\#,k2,6k1+5k4,1/2]&//polsums[\#,k3,29k4,1]&//polsums[\#,k4,5k3,1]&//Simplify][[1]]];pre[i,j],{i,4},{j,i}];  

where the auxiliary vectors are now quite "ugly", then the evaluation  
takes slightly longer, but the result (after applying TrickMandelstam)  
remains the same, because the gauge dependent terms \*must\* cancel out
in  
all physical quantities.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
