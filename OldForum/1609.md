Dear Paulina,  

many thanks. I found the issue and already fixed it in the  
repository. So please reinstall the package.  

Perhaps I should have guessed that Majorana fermions  
are involved. Those are something that was added only not  
so long ago, so such glitches still may exist.  

BTW, since your expression is mostly made of scalar coefficients  
that are irrelevant for the Dirac algebra, you can help FeynCalc  
by isolating those from the very beginning. This way the calculation  
of traces proceeds much faster:  

amp2 = Collect2[DotSimplify[amp],  
   Join[FeynCalc\`Package\`DiracHeadsList,  
    FeynCalc\`Package\`TensorArgsList], IsolateNames -\> KK]  
(\*Check\*)  
FreeQ[FRH[amp],  
  Join[FeynCalc\`Package\`DiracHeadsList,  
   FeynCalc\`Package\`TensorArgsList]]  

ampSquared =  
  DiracSimplify[amp2\*ComplexConjugate[amp2] //
FermionSpinSum]  

ampSquared // FRH  

Usually this trick doesn't work so well when polarization vectors  
and SU(N) matrices are involved, but your amplitude is structurally  
simple enough, so it pays off well.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
