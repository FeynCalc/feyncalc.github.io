Hi, everyone,  

I use FeynCalc8.2.0 in mathematica 8.  

I want to define some functions in the context test\`.  
In the definitions of those functions, I want to  
use some functions in FeynCalc. Besides, functions  
in test\` and functions in FeynCalc\` can be used together.  

However, BeginPackage["test\`",
"HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`"]  
leads to $ContextPath {test\`,HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`,System\`},  
functions such as GA, SP etc are undefined in this $ContextPath.  

If we load FeynCalc in test\`Private\`,i.e.,  
BeginPackage["test\`"]  
...  
Begin["\`Private\`"]  
Needs["HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`"]  
...  
...  
EndPackage[]  
Then in the context text\`, GA etc can be used.  
But how should we load FeynCalc outside test\`?  
Needs["HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`"] only  
add "HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`" to $ContextPath\!  

Thanks  

                       zhang
