Hello,  
I want to start programming in Mathematica to calculate SUSY
things...(for example to define nilpotent variables..or SUSY derivatives
etc) but I have not any skills in programming (I dont know BASIC, C++
etc...) so what would you advise me ...where to start from ?  
may be Mathematika has it's own programing language and I can directly
learn that ? Or should I learn C++ for example..  

Thank you
