In general, the best strategy for such complicated integrals is to
first  
rewrite them in terms of the coefficient functions  

amp = Pair[Momentum[k], Momentum[p1]]^3
FAD[{k, lam}, {(k - q),  
      lam}, {(k - p1), m}, {(k + p2), M}];  

res = TID[amp, k, UsePaVeBasis -\> True, ToPaVe -\> True]  

which quickly returns a rather compact result  

\-3 I \\[Pi]^2 PaVe[0, 0,  
    1, {SPD[p1, p1], SPD[p1, p1] + 2 SPD[p1, p2]
+ SPD[p2, p2],  
     SPD[p2, p2] + 2 SPD[p2, q] + SPD[q, q],
SPD[q, q], SPD[p2, p2],  
     SPD[p1, p1] - 2 SPD[p1, q] + SPD[q, q]},
{lam^2, m^2, M^2, lam^2},  
     PaVeAutoOrder -\> True, PaVeAutoReduce -\> True] SP[p1,
p1]^2 -  
...  

Then, depending on what one wants to do, one can  

1\) Evaluate the coefficient functions numerically using LoopTools,  
Collier or whatever other package  

2\) Evaluate the coefficient functions analytically via Package-X by  
using PaXEvaluate from the FeynHelpers extension  

3\) Reduce the coefficient functions to scalar integral, which would
of  
course generate a huge amount of terms, e.g.  

res[[1]] // PaVeReduce
