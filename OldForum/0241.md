Dear Mlody,  
sorry for the late answer, but I somehow did not get the  
feyncalc-Forum messages automatically anymore and just  
saw your bug-report today.  

Yes, in 5.1beta there is a problem when calling Tr on  
unsimplified expressions.  

We will try to fix the bugs still this month, but in the  
meantime please use, e.g.,  

tr=TR[Calc[\#]]&;  

and then call tr instead of Tr or TR on traces.  

Of course you can do other simplifications (like DiracSimplify , or even
DiracSimplify2 or alike).  

Sorry for the trouble,  

Rolf Mertig
