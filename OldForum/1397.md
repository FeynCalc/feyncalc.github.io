Hi,  

the development version contains some experimental functionality to
deal  
with Cartesian objects, but this is not very well tested, c.f. my
thesis  

\<https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/download/1359697/1359697.pdf\>  

starting with page 166 for a brief description. The exact command would
be  

CLC[a, c, d] CLC[b, c, d] // Contract  

which yields  

2 CartesianPair[CartesianIndex[a],
CartesianIndex[b]]  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
