Hi,  
      As far as I concerned, there are basically two ways to evaluate
any process with explicit Fermion spin.  
      First, you can just write down the amplitude by hand and make it
to matrix elements squared further, when summing over spins, you just
replace the spinor part of explicit spin with
(DiracSlash[p1]-m).â€?(1+GA[5].DiracSlash[sm])
in your caseâ€?. Here p1 is the 4-momentum of muon in center of mass
frame and sm is the spin vector of muon.  
      Second, you can work with amplitude directly by inserting
(1+GA[5].DiracSlash[sm])/2 after
SpinorVBar[p1,mm] and then sum over spins "normally", you will
get the exact same answer.â€?â€?â€?â€?  
  
  
  Further, Here is an attachment I've done not far before for muon decay
with polarization allowed. It is almost the same with your case. For
simplicity, I have just used Fermi Theory instead of standard
electroweak theory. I hope it will help.

Hi,  
  
I was interested in seeing a electro-weak decay of mu+ -\> e+ ve vu,
where mu+ are at rest and a specific alignment. What should I do to the
spinor corresponding to mu ? I found a matrix for mu mu-bar, how do I
include that in the amplitude ?
