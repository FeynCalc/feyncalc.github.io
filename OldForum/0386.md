Hi,  
I tried, and also could not get 0,  
but this is due to the Schouten identity...  
You can play with the Option Schouten of Contract (and also with  
Rename-\>True).  
But it is non-trivial.  

It really is better to just calculate scalar quantities.  

I do not think that there are any bugs in DiracReduce. It is fairly
simple code and biggest problem might be renaming of dummy indices,  
but I think that works fine.  

Regards,  

Rolf
