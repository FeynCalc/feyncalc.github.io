Hello Vladyslav,  

Thank you very much for your answer. I did load the add-on exactly as in
your example on arXiv. I was using FeynCalc 9.2 when I found this
problem so I decided to try with the 9.3 version but the problem
remained. You can find the Mathematica code I am using in the following
GitHub link:

Apparently PaXEvaluate works perfectly while PaXSeries does not.  

Thank you again,  

Cristian
