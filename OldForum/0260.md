Hi  
I was wondering if you could help me with this problem:  
"An arrow is shot upward from the origin with an initial velocity of 300
ft/sec. Assume that there is no air resistance and use the model:  
m(dv/dt)=-mg  
Find the maximum height, and the impact velocity (with the Runge-Kutta
method) using Mathematica.  
(note: g=32)"  

I cant seem to get the right answer (maximum height=1406.25), for this
problem, that i have gotten earlier using analytical methods.  

CODE SO FAR:  
ClearAll[x, y, f, g, v]  
n = 10; g = 32; a = 0; b = 1.0; maxi = 0;  
h = (b-a)/n; x = a; Y = 1;  
f[x\_,y\_] = -g  
Do[{ h = (b-a)/n,  
k1 = h\*f[x,Y], k2 = h\*f[x+h/2,Y+k1/2],  
k3 = h\*f[x+h/2,Y+k2/2], k4 = h\*f[x+h,Y+k1],  
Y = Y + (1/6)(k1+2k2+2k3+k4), x = x+h,  
Print[" y(",x,")", Y], If[Y \> maxi, maxi = Y]}, {i, 1,
n}]  
Print["The maximum height is ", maxi]  

Note: the answers i get from this program are negative numbers, which
are obviously incorrect
