Dear FeynCalc users,  

I've found finally some time to add the support for working with
Majorana  
spinors.  

In principle, FermionSpinSum should be now able to handle products of  
amplitudes that require spinor reordering automatically. For those who  
prefer more fine-grained controls, there are two new functions  
FCChargeConjugateTransposed and SpinorChainTranspose.  

FCChargeConjugateTransposed applies C x^T C^(-1) to x, where x is  
assumed to be an object living in the Dirac space. This operation is  
required when transposing spinor chains so that one can effectively  
switch u und v spinors  

For example  

FCChargeConjugateTransposed[GA[mu, nu, rho], Explicit -\>
True]  

FCChargeConjugateTransposed[GA[5], Explicit -\> True]  

SpinorChainTranspose directly implements the transposition of
particular  
spinor chains in the given expression. The option Select allows to  
specify which types of chains should be transposed by using patterns.
E.g.  

SpinorChainTranspose[  
  SpinorVBarD[p1, m1].GAD[mu].(GSD[p] +
m).GAD[mu].SpinorUD[p2, m2]]  

SpinorChainTranspose[  
  SpinorUBarD[p1, m1].GAD[mu].(GSD[p] +
m).GAD[mu].SpinorVD[p2, m2]]  

SpinorChainTranspose[  
  SpinorUBarD[p1, m1].GAD[mu].(GSD[p] +
m).GAD[mu].SpinorVD[p2, m2],  
  Select -\> {{SpinorUBarD[\_, \_], SpinorVD[\_,
\_]}}]  

As was already mentioned above, FermionSpinSum can take care of the  
spinor reordering without any extra help. This behavior can be turned  
off by setting the new option SpinorChainTranspose to False. This can  
also be used as a cross-check, since amplitudes without Majorana
spinors  
should not require this additional reordering.  

amp = Spinor[Momentum[p1], m,
1].Spinor[-Momentum[p2], m, 1] +  
   Spinor[Momentum[p2], m,
1].Spinor[-Momentum[p1], m, 1]  

FermionSpinSum[amp ComplexConjugate[amp]]  

FermionSpinSum[amp ComplexConjugate[amp],  
  SpinorChainTranspose -\> False]  

In this sense, you have the choice between doing the reordering by
hand  
via SpinorChainTranspose before invoking FermionSpinSum or letting  
FermionSpinSum do everything automatically.  

I've also added one tree-level MSSM example to the dev branch, which  
makes use of the new capabilities.
