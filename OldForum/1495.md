Hello everyone,  

I have written a FeynRules model.fr file in terms of weyl spinors.I have
loaded it in the mathematica session with no problem, the lagrangian and
the vertices which FeynRules derives in terms of weyl spinors seem OK.
But in order to use the model for FeynArts and FeynCalc I have to
convert to dirac notation.I use the command
Ld=WeyltoDirac["lagrangian"] to do it but when FeynRules
calculates vertices for Ld all the vertices including fermions are
omitted.I do not have any idea where the problem comes from.Would you
please help me about this?Thanks in advance.  

Regards
