Hi,  

apart from loading the unitarity gauge extension you also need to set
the  
corresponding gauge rules in CreateFeynAmp  

CreateFeynAmp[diags,GaugeRules-\>{FAGaugeXi[Z]-\>Infinity,FAGaugeXi[W]-\>Infinity,FAGaugeXi[A|S]-\>1}]  

BTW, the amplitudes are generated not by FeynCalc but by FeynArts,
which  
is a different software.  

The included examples that use unitarity gauge merely exploit the fact  
the when expanding in the inverse of the W-mass, the gauge terms are  
neglected, so that g^{mu nu}/m\_W^2 is the only piece that survives.  
Perhaps I should have done it in a more explicit way.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
