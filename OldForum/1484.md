FormCalc supports dim red but is somewhat less flexible than FeynCalc.  
Apart from that  
I'm not aware of other suitable public codes.  

So either you implement it yourself in FORM, or you find a
collaborator  
who can share his/her private codes with you in exchange for a  
co-authorship.  

Cheers,
