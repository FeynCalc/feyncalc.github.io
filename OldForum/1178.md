It works, but when GaugeXi is not 1 you end up with propagators raised  
to integer powers that require IBP reduction to be further simplified.  
For example,  

FAD[{q, m, 4}]  

is just a tadpole raised to 4th power, but without IBP FeynCalc would  
write it as a D-function  

OneLoop[q, FAD[{q, m, 4}]]  

I \\[Pi]^2 D0[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, m^2, m^2, m^2, m^2]  

which is clearly an overkill.  

Have a look at  

https://github.com/FeynCalc/feynhelpers/blob/master/Examples/QCD/QCDThreeGluonVertexOneLoop.m  

for some ideas how to deal with such integrals using FeynHelpers. TID  
is way more convenient for that than OneLoop.  

Cheers,

*\> In what sense ithe OneLoop resticted to the t'Hooft gauge
\_GaugeXi-\>1? Does it also work in the physical gauge \_GaugeXi-\>0?
Could you give an example in general gauge that OneLoop cannot
handle?*
