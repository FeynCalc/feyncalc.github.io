Hi,  

I am working in a problem of gravity as an effective field theory and it
was possible to draw the Feynman diagrams. However, when I tried to
compute the amplitude, the output was:  
Power: Infinite expression 1/0^2 encounted.  

Indeterminate  

This was not a completely surprise to me, but is there any way to do
FeynArts+FeynCalc work with models of QFT coupled to gravity as an
EFT?  

Best regard, Huan Souza.
