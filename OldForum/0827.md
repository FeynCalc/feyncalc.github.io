Hi Sam,  

the thing is that in FeynCalc all non-commutative objects (like Dirac
or  
SU(N) matrices) must be separated by a "." simply because in
Mathematica  
the usual multiplication "a\*b===b\*a" is commutative while  
the "." multiplication is not "a.b=\!=b.a".  

In your code you enter Dirac matrices without the "." as if the
ordering  
doesn't matter, so no wonder that the result is ambiguous. With  

Tr[DiracMatrix[a]. DiracMatrix[b].
DiracMatrix[c]. DiracMatrix[d]]  

and  

Tr[DiracMatrix[a]. DiracMatrix[\\[Beta]].  
   DiracMatrix[c] .DiracMatrix[\\[Delta]]]  

you get the correct result in both cases.  

BTW, you can also use "GA" instead of DiracMatrix  
(see \<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/wiki/FAQ\#fci\_fce\>  
for more details) which is much more compact:  

Tr[GA[a,b,c,d]]===(Tr[GA[a,\\[Beta],c,\\[Delta]]]/.{\\[Beta]-\>b,\\[Delta]-\>d})  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
