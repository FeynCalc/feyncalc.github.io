Feng Feng and me just released FormLink and FeynCalcFormLink,  
described here:  
<http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/1212.3522>  
and here:  
<http://www.feyncalc.org/formlink>  

The packages are easily installed by evaluating in Mathematica:  

   Import[\\\\\\"<http://www.feyncalc.org/formlink/install.m>\\\\\\"]  

While writing the Mathematica-based installer I also added  
a new installer for FeynCalc which can be invoked as  

   Import[\\\\\\"<http://www.feyncalc.org/install.m>\\\\\\"]  

This still installs the current fc820 version.  

If people are insterested in a FeynCalc 9 update, please email  
me notebooks, suggestions, problems etc.
