Dear All.  

I compose a paper with the title "A proposal to design expert system for
the  
calculations in the domain of QFT".  

I will be grateful if you take a glance at it and tell yours expert
opinions  
before I upload the paper to ArXiv (now I'm thinking how to present  
Mathematica nb files in the paper).  

Thanks you in in advance.  

Andrey Siver
