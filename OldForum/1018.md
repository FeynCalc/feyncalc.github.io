Hi,  

I am using FeynCalc package in Mathematica to calculate some complicated
Traces, but I think the default convention for the anticommutator of two
Gamma matrices in this package is with positive a sign on the right-hand
side as  

${\\gamma^\\mu,\\gamma^\\nu}=+2\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}$  

I would like to change this convention to the one with a negative sign,
i.e  

${\\gamma^\\mu,\\gamma^\\nu}=-2\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}$  

how can I do that once for all?  

Thanks,  
Naser
