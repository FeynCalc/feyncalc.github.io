Hi folks,  

  Because I plan to submiit some Mathematica jobs using FeynCalc as the
background jobs on some workstations, I use the executable "math"
instead of "mathematica". However, the results from "math" are kind of
weird:  

In[2]:= Commutator[a,b]  

Out[2]= FeynCalcForm[Commutator[a, b]]  

In[3]:= Commutator[a,b]=1  

Out[3]= FeynCalcForm[1]  

In[4]:= DotSimplify[a.b-b.a]  

Out[4]= FeynCalcForm[DotSimplify[a . b - b .
a]]  

If I use "mathematica" instead, It can correctly
DotSimplify[a.b-b.a] to become 1. So my questionis: Is the
FeynCalc compatible with the command interface "math"? If so, what's
wrong with the above results? If not, how can I run jobs as background
of workstations?  

Thanks\!  
Kiniu
