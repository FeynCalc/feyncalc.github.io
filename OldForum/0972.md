FeynCalc 9.0 doesn't modify default Mathematica settings anymore, so
now  
there is no need to change options of Integrate before or after
running  
FeynCalc.  

Cheers,

*\> I noticed this last year as well. I wasn't sure if it was
intentional so that the integrals would just ignore infinities in the
limits (as if they were some UV or IR divergence that would be regulated
away by counterterms). Basically I have to do:*  
*\> Integrate[F[x],{x,0,1}, GenerateConditions-\>
True]*  
*\> for every integral I do that I think might diverge. Though this also
forces me to make a LOT of assumptions about the variables being used,
but its not that bad.*
