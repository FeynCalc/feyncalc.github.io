Hi all,  
  
I try to run the Mathematica interface for FormCalc, but after I made  
  
\<\< PROCESS-MODEL.m  
  
on Mathematica (I used for example eettA-SM.m), and  
  
./configure  
    make  
  
into PROCESS-MODEL.fortran directory, I got the following error:  
  
In file included from renconst//CalcRenConst.F:16:0:  
./F/decl.h:25:0: fatal error: looptools.h: No such file or directory  
compilation terminated.  
make: \*\*\* [renconst//CalcRenConst.o] Error 1  
  
It seems the problem comes from the LoopTools package, that when I run  
./configure  
    make  
  
into LoopTools-2.12 directory I got an error:  
   
gfortran: internal compiler error: Killed (program f951)  
Please submit a full bug report,  
with preprocessed source if appropriate.  
See \<<file:///usr/share/doc/gcc-4.7/README.Bugs>\> for instructions.  
make[1]: \*\*\* [Ecoeffa.o] Error 4  
make[1]: \*\*\* Waiting for unfinished jobs....  
make[1]: Leaving directory
\`/home/safi/RECENT-9-14/LoopTools-2.9/build'  
make: \*\*\* [default] Error 2  
  
  
So does it mean looptools.h could not be built by "make", although I
have gfortran and GNU on my operating system ( I'm using ubuntu) ?  
  
So any help about this please,  
  
Safinaz
