Hi Vladyslav ,  

*\>Could you may be provide me a reference for the occurence of your*  
*\>formula (obviously I'm not familiar with it)? I want to understand
how the general proof goes and what are the steps that might cause
problems with computer codes.*  
*\>*  
*\>Does this relation hold only in 4 or also in D-dimensions (if yes,
in*  
*\>what scheme, naive or t'Hooft Veltman?). If it is a purely 4D
equality then I suppose that the proof might involve SPVAT
(scalar,pseudoscalar,vector,axial vector, tensor) decomposition of A and
B. This might be a good starting point to investigate things.*  
The proof of this formula is much simpler. All you have to do is to use
the well-known formula for three Dirac matrices:  

GA[a].GA[b].GA[c]=MT[a,
b].GA[c]+MT[b, c].GA[a]-MT[a,
c].GA[b]-iGA[5].GA[d].Eps[d, a, b,
c];  

Just substitute it into both traces, multiply them, get 16 terms and
simplify all the things. You will get required answer which don't know
anything about the structure of A and B. So it is valid for any A and
B.  

According to D-dimensions - I'm not sure here. Maybe we can generalize
this formula to D dimensions, but we did not tried to do that.  

Best Regards,  
Nikita Belyaev.
