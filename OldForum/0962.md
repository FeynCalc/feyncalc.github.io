Â Hi Vladyslav ,  

*\>sorry for the late reply. I must also apologize because the FORM
code*  
*\>that I sent you was not correct.*  
That's really bad news because we've already started celebration :(  

*\>Please find the corrected code attached.*  
*\>May be you could also check what happens if you compute just*  
*\>Line13\*Line14 or Line15\*Line16.*  
*\>*  
*\>Do those results agree with what you computed by hand?*  
Totally not. Each term providing a half of FeynCalc's result (5
non-canceling terms with u^3 as before). The same story with other
traces which also had been validated to be real by hand.  

In the previous email you've also noticed that our traces contain part
like (1+GA[5].GS[s]) and (GS[p]+-m). It is
correct as far as the first expression has taking into account the
polarization of initial particle and the +- sign has related to particle
and antiparticle.  

Do you have any other ideas about what might be wrong? Because I'm
completely lost with that, everything should be correct.  

Best Regards,  
Nikita Belyaev
