Hi,  

polarization sums are computed via DoPolarizationSums.  

See here  

<[0844.html](0844.html)>  

for the description and links to examples. The examples are now in  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/tree/master/FeynCalc/Examples\>  

so please correct the links accordingly.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
