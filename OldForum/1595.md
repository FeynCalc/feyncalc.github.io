Hi,  

Cartesian stuff is officially available (and also documented) since  
FeynCalc 9.3,  
but it's true that there are virtually no examples on using it in real  
calculations.  
Some (partly outdated) details can be found in Sec 24.2 of  

https://inspirehep.net/literature/1670088  

There should be a publication addressing NR calculations with FeynCalc  
appearing rather soon O(1-2 weeks).  

Long story short, what you need are CLC and CLCD  

https://feyncalc.github.io/FeynCalcBook/ref/CLC.html  
https://feyncalc.github.io/FeynCalcBook/ref/CLCD.html  

CLC[a, b, c] CLC[a, b, e] // Contract // FCE  
(\*2 KD[c, e]\*)  

CLCD[a, b, c] CLCD[a, b, e] // Contract // FCE  
(\*6 KDD[c, e] - 5 D KDD[c, e] + D^2 KDD[c,
e]\*)  

Notice that here Cartesian tensors live in D-1 dimensions  
because they are defined to be spatial pieces of the corresponding  
Lorentz tensors. That is, you have need to consider D-1 -\> 3, not
D-\>3  
to get the right limit.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
