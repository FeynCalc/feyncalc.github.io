*\>I've been trying out fc8beta3 and a few things don't work out as
\>expected, two of them:*  

*\>1. ComplexConjugate does not act on LorentzIndex*  
Yes. ComplexConjugate is basically broken. See the comments in
ComplexConjugate.m I could try to fix it, but then Phi will have
trouble. However, it is probably not at all easy to do this right.  
So, if someone has a few days or weeks time: feel free to send me an
improved version (with test cases).  

*\>2. Expressions such as*  
*\>Eps[Momentum[p1], Momentum[p2],
Momentum[p3], Momentum[p4 + p5]]*  
*\>do not simplify. I am using it with Mathematica 8*  
You could either explicitly use MomentumExpand first, or change  
ExpandSclalarProduct to MomentumExpand in
HighEnergyPhysics/fctools/EpsEvaluate.m  
Then also the Calc function will do.  

    --
    Feel free to send more (as concrete as possible) problems or bugs.
    If it is easy I will fix it right away. If it takes longer, I am afraid I have no time (doing this all as an unpaid hobby now).
