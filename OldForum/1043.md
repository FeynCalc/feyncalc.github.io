Hi, Vladyslav  

Thank you very much for the update.  

I have used the development version. Everything quite works well.  

However, I still have two questions:  

1\. After running your codes, I find most of the parameters in
“SM\_Unitary\_Gauge” are modified as FCGV[EL],
FCGV[SW], …. Is it to avoid conflicts with other definitions?  

2\. I find the function LorentzIndexNames in FCFAConvert[]
doesn’t work sometimes, in both 9.0.1 and development version, and for
both default model and added model. For example, after running the
following codes  

$LoadFeynArts = True;  
<<FeynCalc\`;  
$FAVerbose = 0;  

tops3 = CreateTopologies[0, 1 -\> 3];  
inserttops3 =  
  InsertFields[  
   tops3, {F[2, {3}]} -\> {F[1, {3}], -F[3, {1,
o}], F[4, {1, o}]},  
   InsertionLevel -\> {Particles}, LastSelections -\>
{V[3]}];  

FCFAConvert[CreateFeynAmp[inserttops3], ChangeDimension -\>
4,  
  LorentzIndexNames -\> {lor}, IncomingMomenta -\> {p1},  
  OutgoingMomenta -\> {k, k1, k2}, DropSumOver -\> True,  
  List -\> False] // Contract  

I find the option LorentzIndexNames doesn’t work if I set
OutgoingMomenta -\> {k, k1, k2} or {k0, k1, k2}, but not {k3,k1,k2}  

(The FCGV[] in the output seems also quite strange.)  

Thank you again for your time.  

Best Regards,  
Xing-Bo Yuan
