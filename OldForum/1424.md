Hey guys,  

My Problem is that I want solve a System with n equation of Motion in
first order. In this equation of motion are creation and annihilation
operators of Dirac-fermions. I don't know and don't find a it, how I can
describes the creation and annihilation operators of Dirac-fermions in
Mathematica and then I want to solve the equation of motion.  

I have asked the Question also by community.wolfram.com.  

Thanks, for your help.
