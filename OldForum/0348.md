*\>Hi all\!*

This should work.  
   

*\>It seems that Lorenz contraction is default operation in \>lagrangian
constructions or in "FeynRule" operation.*  
Yes.  

*\>File with calculations I&\#8217;m ready to send if needed.*  
   
OK, send me something (as easy to reproduce as possible please) to rolf
AT mertig.com and I'll have a look.
