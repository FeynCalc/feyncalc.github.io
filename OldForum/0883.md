Following the suggestion of Yu Lu we've added additional  
options to slightly customize typesetting of momenta,  
Dirac matrices, metric tensors and polarization vectors  
in 4, D-4, and D-dimensions:  

https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/commit/241b402e57f7571a4a014852f17a9fb5a59d9903  

The attached notebook shows how this may look like.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
