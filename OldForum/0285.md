hi -  

i use unix and mathematica5  

are there any paths/ ... you could still be required to set ??  

e.g. if i start mathematca in the Mathematica/Applications directory
itself, i get  

 \\\!\\(\\\*FormBox[  
  RowBox[{\\(TagSet::"tagpos"\\), \\(\\(:\\)\\(\\ \\)\\),
"\\\<\\"Tag \\  
\\\\\!\\\\(TraditionalForm\\\\\`Re\\\\) in \\  
\\\\\!\\\\n\\\\(TraditionalForm\\\\\`\\\\(\\\\(\\\\(\\\\(\\\\(Re(OPEm)\\\\)\\\\)
- \\  
\\\\(\\\\(Re(i)\\\\)\\\\)\\\\)\\\\) \> 0\\\\)\\\\)\\\\n is too deep for
an assigned rule to be \\  
found.
\\\\\!\\\\(\\\\\*ButtonBox[\\\\\\"More\\[Ellipsis]\\\\\\",
\\  
ButtonStyle-\>\\\\\\"RefGuideLinkText\\\\\\", ButtonFrame-\>None, \\  
ButtonData:\>\\\\\\"TagSet::tagpos\\\\\\"]\\\\)\\"\\\>"}],
TraditionalForm]\\)  

so a different error message... but it should find all the applicartions
don't you think ??  

e.g. $Path contains also the .Mathematica/Applications file...
