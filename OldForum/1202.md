It depends on the size of your calculation and your treatment of IR  
divergences. In any case PaXEvaluate (e.g. Package-X) can handle IR  
divergences regularized dimensionally.  

But for "real" big pheno calculations PaXEvaluate will be probably too  
slow and will return huge symbolic results.  

If you regularize IR divergences with fake masses (which is LoopTools  
default), then you could just tell LoopTools to give you the
coefficient  
of the 1/eps pole (I think it works via SetLambda, but one has to
check  
it carefully) and construct the full result of the loop integral as  

c0/eps + c1  

after which you can put D=4-2 eps and use Series to expand around
eps=0.
