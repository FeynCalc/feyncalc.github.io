Dear FeynCalc users,  

a new online version of the FeynCalc book is available:  

\<https://feyncalc.github.io/FeynCalcBook/guide/FeynCalc.html\>  

As compared to the current  

\<<http://www.feyncalc.org/FeynCalcBook/>\>  

version from 1999, it features new nice layout and was generated  
from the documentation shipped with FeynCalc 9.1.  

Later on we will link it to the main website.  
Your comments/suggestions are welcome.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
