Hello,  

thanks for the suggestion. That's indeed what I did in the meantime.  
I just wanted to know whether this was possible to implement at a more
basic level given the EpsEvaluate[] description
"EpsEvaluate[expr] applies total antisymmetry and linearity
(w.r.t. Momentum's) to all Levi-Civita tensors (Eps') in expr.".  
I understand it is not from your comments. Thanks a lot for your
answer\!  

Pablo
