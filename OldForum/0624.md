I'm attempting to install FeynCalc 4.1.1.0 to work with Mathematica 7 on
Linux. I ran into the following problem. After unzipping the tarball in
my \~/.Mathematica/Applications directory, I tried to to initialize the
program with:  

\<\<HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`  

but I just get the reply  

"Could not find FeynCalc installation. Quitting the Mathematica
kernel."  

I have double checked that the above directory is in my Mathematica
$Path and also my $UserBaseDirectory. Furthermore, I have installed
other packages by placing them in this directory and they run
successfully out of the box.  

Is this a Mathematica 7 issue? Do I need to load the package with a
different command? Thank you.
