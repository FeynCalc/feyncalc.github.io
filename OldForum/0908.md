Hi,  

it depends on what you want to do with H.  
First of all, FeynCalc doesn't deal with explicit components of  
vectors and spinors. If you are working on the level of amplitudes,  
then  

h = Contract[SpinorUBar[p2,
m2].GA[mu].SpinorU[p1, m1]  
PolarizationVector[q, mu]]  

is the simplest form you can get. Of course you can insert  
explicit components using Mathematica and do the multiplication  
of spinors and Dirac matrices, but for that you don't really need  
FeynCalc. On the other hand, if you want to compute matrix element  
squared, then you cold do say  

h2 = FermionSpinSum[h ComplexConjugate[h]] // Tr  

and then replace scalar products with some explicit values that are  
given by the kinematics you choose,like  

h2 /. {FCI[SP[p1, p2]] -\> E1\*E2 -
p1v\*p2v\*Cos[theta]}  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
