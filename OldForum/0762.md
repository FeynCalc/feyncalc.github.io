Before you load FeynCalc try to set  

HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`$FeynArtsDirectory="/Users/Roman/Library/Mathematica/FeynCarts"  

If you have problems with FeynArts 3.8: try FeynArts 3.4  

Notice that you can inhibit loading of FeynArts and Phi by setting  
$LoadFeynArts = $LoadPhi = False  
before loading FeynCalc, i.e., before  
Needs["HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`"]
