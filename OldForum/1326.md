I want to draw diagrams of t-\>ql^+l^- using FeynArts.  

First, I used this code  

t1 = CreateTopologies[0, 1 -\> 3];  
t2 = InsertFields[t1, {F[3, {3}]} -\> {F[3],
-F[2], F[2]}, InsertionLevel -\> {Classes}, GenericModel
-\> {Lorentz}, Model -\> {SM}];  
Paint[t2]  
I got satisfied result. If I change InsertionLevel to Particles, I still
get t-\>ul^+l^- where lepton can be electron, muon, and tau.  

However, I got a problem when I change F[3] for the outgoing
particle to F[3,{1}]. I don't get any diagrams from this code. I
think I should get t-\>ul^+l^- with unspecified lepton.  

I want to know what is the problem of my code.
