Hi,  
I have another question, I try to get a Feynman Rule for a Lagrangian
term that involve fermions, for example:  
(QuantumField[h,{li4,li5},{1}] MT[li4,li5]
MT[li1,li2] -
QuantumField[h,{li1,li2},{1}]).QuantumField[QuarkField].GA[li1].CovariantD[li2,Explicit-\>True].QuantumField[QuarkField].  

Questions:  
1\) When I put the field to be on the left, does it automatically know
that it's Q\_bar (complex\_conjugate.GA[0] ?) The out of this
line, doesn't show that, but It could just be that you don't bother to
format the output.  

2\) When I take the functional Derivative, and I want to have 1 fermion
in and and 1 fermion out (the momentum line follow the fermion line) How
should I specify my fields? Here is what I have, which seems to give me
a factor of 2 bigger than when I would derive the Feynman Rule by
hand:  
{QuantumField[h,{\\[Mu],\\[Nu]},{1}],QuantumField[QuarkField][k1],QuantumField[QuarkField][k2]}  

What did I do wrong?  
Thanks,  
My Phuong
