Sir,  
I work in the field of CHPT.  

Just few days back, I used FeynCalc in IKP, Juelich on UNIX based
machine. I calculated few diagrms.After coming back to India,I am trying
to install FeynCalc on my system (window based) which has Mathematica
4.1 version. I need urgently to use Feyncalc to continue my
calculations.  

I did the following.  

1\) I downloaded hep-4.1.1.0.zip and unzipped it in c:\\program
files\\wolfram  
research\\Mathematica\\4.1\\Addons\\Applications  
2\) Rebuilt the help index  
3\) opened a new Mathematica file with the commnad  
\<\<HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`  

4)I got the message:  

*\>From In[1]:=*  
Get::noopen: Cannot open HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`.  

Out[1]=  
$Failed  

I tried both in Windows 98/2000 to install. I was not succesful.  

Please help me.  

with regards  
K.B. Vijaya Kumar
