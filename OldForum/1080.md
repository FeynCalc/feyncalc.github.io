Hi Maxim,  

let me contribute to the resolution of the discrepancy.  

The point is that at the end of the computation OneLoop converts  
all the D-dimensional 4-vectors and metric tensors to 4-dimensions.  

This is also what one normally does when doing computation by hand,  
so there is no issue here. However, if the output of OneLoop is not
the  
full expression that you want to evaluate but just a part of it, one has
to  
be careful.  

In particular, if the output of OneLoop contains metric tensors and
you  
want to contract it with D-dimensional metric tensors, then you have
to  
convert your expression back to D-dimensions first. Otherwise, from  
contracting g^{mu nu} g\_{mu nu} you obtain 4 instead of D, which
gives  
the rise to the discrepancy that you have been observing.  

The correct way of writing the code is  

ScalarProduct[q1, q1] = 0;  
ScalarProduct[q2, q2] = 0;  
ScalarProduct[q3, q3] = 0;  
den = FAD[{q, 0}, {q - q1, 0}, {q - q1 - q2, 0}, {q - q1 - q2 -
q3,  
    0}];  

ex1 = Contract[(OneLoop[q, den\*SP[q, q]\*FV[q,
mu]\*FV[q, nu]] //  
      ChangeDimension[\#, D] &)\*MTD[mu, nu]] //
PaVeReduce  

ex2 = OneLoop[q, den\*SP[q, q]^2] // PaVeReduce //  
  ChangeDimension[\#, D] &  

and the difference is zero, as it should be.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
