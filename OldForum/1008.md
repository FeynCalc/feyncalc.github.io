Thanks for the reply.  

It is known that in FC9.0 we must change the output form to avoid
warnings before loading:  
SetOptions[$FrontEndSession,  
Â "CommonDefaultFormatTypes" -\> {"Output" -\> TraditionalForm}],  

Before I load the SetOption command, the Output is "normal"  
Input: 1+r-z  
Output: 1+r-z  
[Note in the above expression, I mean 1(The number "one")+r-z, not
l(the letter)+r-z]  

after I loaded the SetOption command, the output changed:  
Input: 1+r-z  
Output: r-z+1  

Now I realize this problem comes from Mathematica, not FenyCalc.
