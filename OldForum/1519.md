Dear Developer;  

When I use TID to do HiggstoGluonGluon oneloop calculation, the result
was wrong, and it was same with the calculation that I used Oneloop with
oneloopsimplify which was not recommend .  

Then I set $LimitTo4=True, the result of OneLoop with OneLoopSimplify
was True(agree with my derivation) and the result of TID was still
wrong.  

I take apart the amplitude into pieces, and I found the one which cause
the problem, that is  

FeynAmpDenominator[PropagatorDenominator[Momentum[k,D]],PropagatorDenominator[Momentum[k,D]+Momentum[p1,D]],PropagatorDenominator[Momentum[k,D]+Momentum[p1,D]+Momentum[p2,D]]]
Pair[LorentzIndex[mu,D],Momentum[k,D]]
Pair[LorentzIndex[nu,D],Momentum[k,D]]  

in which "k" is loop monentum, and we set all mass to zero, that means
p1.p1=0, p2.p2=0.  

\#\# four differnt ways  

1\. $LimitTo4=False (default) , use Oneloop with oneloopsimplify  
2\. $LimitTo4=False (default) , use TID  
\#\#\#\# 3. $LimitTo4=True, use Oneloop with oneloopsimplify  
4\. $LimitTo4=True, use TID  

\#\# we found only the thrid way gave the right answers(agreed with my
derivation)  

we expect to get the third answers ($LimitTo4=True,use Oneloop with
oneloopsimplify) , there should be a term which is not contain B0/C0.  

(I \\[Pi]^2 Subscript[B, 0](2 p1p2,0,0) (p1p2 g^(munu)-2
p2^mu p1^nu-2 p1^mu p2^nu+3 p1^mu p1^nu-p2^mu p2^nu))/(4 p1p2)+I
\\[Pi]^2 p1^mu p1^nu Subscript[C, 0](0,0,2
p1p2,0,0,0)+(I \\[Pi]^2 (p1p2 g^(munu)-p2^mu p1^nu-p1^mu
p2^nu))/(4 p1p2)  

TID cannot get the right answer\!
