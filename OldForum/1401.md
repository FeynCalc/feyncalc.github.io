If you are still using FeynCalc for loop calculations (probably  
something nonstandard, since for standard things there are FormCalc,  
MadGraph, GoSam and co), have a look at FeynHelpers.  

Especially for EFT matching calculations, the interface to Package-X
is  
super useful, since it allows you to get a full analytic result for  
almost any PaVe function.  

Cheers,
