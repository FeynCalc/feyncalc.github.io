I tried to used the patched version of FeynCalc on Mathematica 6.0 (Mac
OS).  
Somehow when I try to look for the help in regard to installed AddOns
(via Mathematica help browser), Mathematica crashes. This happens only
if I try to browse the introduction to and Starting FeynCalc options.
For rest of the things it works nicely.  

I tried using FeynArts with new version of Mathematica, somehow it
doesn't work. When I try to paint the topologies, it doesn't showup the
diagrams in output.  

thanks
