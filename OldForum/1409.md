  Hi Vladyslav,At first,If I want to do parallel computing, how can I
call multiple cores at the same time?And then,the command of OneLoop has
an error that is "Error\! OneLoop has encountered a fatal problem and
must abort the computation. The problem reads:OneLoop cannot be used for
computations in the BMHV or Larin schemes. Use TID instead.What can I do
to solve these problems.  
 Thanks\!
