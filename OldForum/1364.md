I don't understand why you need to close FeynCalc to compute
something.  

Integrate2 and DeltaFunction are FeynCalc objects and become
meaningless  
to Mathematica when FeynCalc is not loaded.  

Mathematica can calculate  

Integrate[DiracDelta[y - x] y, {x, 0, 1}]  

independently of FeynCalc being loaded or not.

Is there any way?*
