Dear FeynCalc users,  

In \`\`official" FeynCalc examples the identity matrix is not used under
the trace. However, it seems that sometimes this yields wrong results
when chiral projectors are present. Is this an expected bahavior, or I
am doing something wrong? (I'm using FeynCalc 9.2.0 with Mathematica
8.0.4.)  

(\*Definitions\*)  

In[2]:= ID = GA[6] + GA[7];  
   
In[3]:= y1 = L1 GA[7] + R1 GA[6];  
   
In[4]:= y2 = L2 GA[7] + R2 GA[6];  
   

(\*Worng result\*)  

In[5]:= Tr[y1.(GS[p2] + m2).y2.(GS[p1] -
m1)] // FCE  
   
Out[5]= -2 (L2 R1 + L1 R2) (m1 m2 - SP[p1, p2])  
   
(\*Correct result\*)  

In[6]:= Tr[y1.(m2).y2.(-m1)]  
   
Out[6]= -2 m1 m2 (L1 L2 + R1 R2)  
   

(\*Correct result\*)  

In[7]:= Tr[y1.(GS[p2] + m2 ID).y2.(GS[p1] -
m1 ID)] // Simplify // FCE  
   
Out[7]= -2 m1 m2 (L1 L2 + R1 R2) + 2 (L2 R1 + L1 R2) SP[p1,
p2]  

Thanks and best wishes,  
Ula
