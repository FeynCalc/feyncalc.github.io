It has been a long time since this question was asked, but I just
would  
like to point out that this is issue is being worked on.  

Since today the development version finally offers a possibility to  
enter propagators different from 1/(k^2-m^2).  

The residual mass HQET propagator can be written using the new SFAD  
representation:  
{% raw %}
SFAD[{{0, q.p}, m^2}]  
{% endraw %}
while  
{% raw %}
SFAD[{{0, q.p}}]  
{% endraw %}
is the familiar SCET propagator 1/p.q  

At the moment one cannot really do much with it, i.e. the standard  
functions like TID, FDS, ApartFF etc. will not process such integrals,  
but this is just the first step.  

It will of course take time to properly integrate SFAD (and its  
Cartesian version CFAD) into FeynCalc, but this is something I'm
really  
working on.  

Cheers,

*\> In HQET(Heavy Quark Effective Theory) we come across may loop
integrals where one of the propagators is v.k rather than k.k-m^2. I was
wondering if there is a way for OneLoop to handle these integrals? An
example would be:*  
*\>*  
*\> AMP = FAD[{q,m}] 1/(ScalarProduct[q,v]-X);*  
*\> OneLoop[q,AMP]*  
*\>*  
*\> Gives 0, but the answer by hand is not zero. (X here is just some
constant to displace the propagator.)*  
*\>*  
*\> The actual result can be found a number of places:*  
*\> (<http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9605342> Equation \# 407)*  
*\>*  
*\> Is there a way to input that second part so OneLoop can calculate
it?*
