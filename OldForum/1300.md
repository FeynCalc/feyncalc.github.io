Hi\!  

I'm evaluating a 2-to-3 cross-section. The matrix element takes the
form  

f = 1/(ScalarProduct[k1 + k2, k1 + k2] - mp^2)
PolarizationVector[  
   k2, \\[Mu]] SpinorUBar[p1,  
    mp].GA[\\[Nu]].(vf - af GA5).(GS[k1 +
k2] + mp).GA[\\[Mu]].SpinorU[  
    k1, mp] SpinorUBar[p3, m].GA[\\[Nu]].(1
- GA5).SpinorV[p2, 0]  

After a lot of integrations I obtain negative result for the
cross-section. However, if I change GS[k1 + k2] + mp to
GS[k1 + k2] - mp, the result is positive.  

Could you please clarify this point? Maybe there is internal convention
about signs inside the fermion propagator, according to metric sign
convention and other, or something like that?  

P.S. I've checked all other steps of the calculation.
