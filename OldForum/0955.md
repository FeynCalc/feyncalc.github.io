Sorry for the inconvenience. With the latest commits I've improved  
couple of things to ensure that pieces that require further  
simplification will be caught by the lower functions before they go
into  
the main algorithm of TID. So now it should work.  

Please let me know if there are still issues with your expressions.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
