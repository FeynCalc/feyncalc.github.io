Currently I am doing the diagrams for a 2-\>3 and I noticed that
CreateFCAmp/FAToFC incorrectly assigns the momenta to a spinor.
Basically it takes an incoming photon momenta and assigns that to the
spinor rather than the quark. I cannot attach an example (do I need to
be a subscriber?). So here is example code.  
FIRST the correct way (a 2-\>1 example)  

$LoadFeynArts = True;  
$LoadPhi = True;  
<<HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`;  

tops = CreateTopologies[0, 2 -\> 1, ExcludeTopologies -\> {},
Adjacencies -\> 3];  
inserted = InsertFields[tops, {F[3, {1}], V[1]} -\>
{F[3, {1}]},  
   Model -\> "SMQCD", ExcludeParticles -\> {S[a\_],
V[1], V[2], V[3]}];  
Paint[inserted, PaintLevel -\> {Classes}];  

CreateFeynAmp[inserted]  
CreateFCAmp[inserted]  

(\* THIS IS CORRECT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, LOOK AT THE SPINOR MOMENTA
ASSIGNMENTS. IT CHANGED {P1,P2-\> K1} to {P1, P2-\> P3}\*)  

(\* NOW LETS DO IT FOR A 2-\>3 \*)  
tops = CreateTopologies[0, 3 -\> 2, ExcludeTopologies -\> {},  
   Adjacencies -\> 3];  
inserted = InsertFields[  
   tops, {F[3, {1}], -F[4, {1}], V[1]} -\>
{F[3, {1}], -F[4, {1}]},  
   Model -\> "SMQCD", ExcludeParticles -\> {S[a\_],
V[1], V[2], V[3]}];  
Paint[inserted, PaintLevel -\> {Classes}];  

(\* LOOK AT THE FIRST LINE, NOTICE THE MOMENTA ASSIGNMENTS, THE PHOTON
IS P3 THEN LOOK AT THE SPINOR ASSIGNMENTS IN THE CREATEFCAMP, ITS
INCORRECT\*)  

CreateFeynAmp[inserted]  
CreateFCAmp[inserted]
