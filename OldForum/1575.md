Hi,  

I was studying the $phi^4$ theory renormalisation (MS,MSbar) example,
kindly made available by you. However, the result for the g counterterm
is a bit strange to me ($\\delta\_g=\\frac{3\\Delta g}{32\\pi^2}). In
the other example you made available, $\\phi\\phi$-\>$\\phi\\phi$, the
value used was $\\delta\_g=\\frac{3\\Delta g^2}{32\\pi^2}$ (which is the
value showed in Peskin and Schroeder, eq. 12.45). In this way, could you
enlighten me about this divergence between the results?  

Since now, thank you for your time and patience.  

Best regards,  

Huan Souza.
