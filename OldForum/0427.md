Dear All,  
Can I multiply Dirac Gamma Matrices by an arbitrary matrix?  
When I try to do so, it treats my arbitrary matrix as a matrix but Gamma
as a not matrix but like a just number, it directly multiplies all
elements of my arbitrary matrix simply by gamma.  
   
If I am not clear pls give me your feedbck and I will try to precise my
question.  
   
Cheers  
George
