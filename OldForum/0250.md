Dear Rolf,  

We appreciate the help understanding these trace bugs. Does this bug
persist if the traces result from calulating applitudes using
FeyArts/Phi. For instance in the following example  

tops = CreateTopologies[args]  
inserts = InsertFields[tops, ....]  
ampFA = CreateFeynAmp[inserts, ....]  
ampFC = FAToFC[ampFA, DiracTraceEvaluate -\> True]  

Can we assume that the traces in ampFC will be evaluated properly or is
a workaround required?  

Many thanks  
Jon Palmer
