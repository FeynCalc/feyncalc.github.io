hello, dear developers and specialists in FeynCalc. I had some problem
with the built-in Passarino Veltman functions such as B0, A0 etc. I need
to plot their graphs, howeverWolfram Mathematica doesn't seem to handle
them as ordinary functions.  
Is there any possible solution for using Passarino Veltman functions as
ordinary Mathematica functions and plotting their graphs of arguments?
thanks.
