By the way, Feynman rules tell me that there must be
GS[k1+k2]+mp.  

Maybe similar question, but I don't understand why the traces  

DiracTrace[ComplexConjugate[QuarkPropagator[{p,
m}]]] /.  
   DiracTrace -\> TR // Contract // Simplify  
DiracTrace[QuarkPropagator[{p, m}]] /. DiracTrace -\> TR
//  
  Contract // Simplify  

give similar results (4im/(p^2-m^2)), while they must be different
because of the sign.
