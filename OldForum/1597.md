There is no need to make it so complicated. You can just employ a  
slightly more generic replacement rule  

rule = {  
   DiracTrace[  
     DOT[DiracGamma[a\_, D], DiracGamma[b\_, D],
DiracGamma[c\_, D],  
      DiracGamma[d\_, D], DiracGamma[5]]] :\> 4
I Eps[a, b, c, d],  

   DiracTrace[  
     DOT[DiracGamma[a\_, D], DiracGamma[b\_, D],
DiracGamma[c\_, D],  
      DiracGamma[d\_, D], DiracGamma[e\_, D],
DiracGamma[f\_, D],  
      DiracGamma[5]]] :\> myChiralTrace6[a, b, c, d,
e, f]  
   }  

ex = DiracTrace[  
      GAD[tau, mu, ka].GSD[p1].GAD[nu, rho, ka, si,
tau, 5].GSD[p2]] //  
      DiracSimplify // ReplaceAll[\#, rule] & // EpsEvaluate  

and so on for 8 or more matrices. It doesn't matter whether those are  
GADs or GSDs.
