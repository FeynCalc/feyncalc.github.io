Thanks a lot, that's wonderful\!  
It's exactly what I was waiting for.  

However, when installing the development version I get a warning message
when evaluating the expression below (in the rpevious version there was
no warning)  

Contract[LC[mu,nu,rho,sigma] FV[k,mu]
FV[P,rho]]]  

The warning message being,  

RuleDelayed::rhs: "Pattern FeynCalc\`EpsEvaluate\`Private\`a\_ appears
on the right-hand side of rule
FeynCalc\`EpsEvaluate\`Private\`a\_:\>FeynCalc\`EpsEvaluate\`Private\`a\_"  

THe outcome is correct nevertheless.  
Should I stop using this kind of arguments in the new version?
