Thank you\!  

The way you suggested partly solved my problem, but if I wanna take
trace with something mixing with GSD, the ReplaceAll then doesn't work
well.  
I now treat my problem with some clumsy way and the steps are as
follows:  
first, I finish taking trace in D-dimension, and let the result shown in
StandardForm;  
then, I replace all Ds with 4s and thus bring DiracTrace with
GA[5] back to 4 dimension;  
finally, I simplify the results from the 2nd step with DiracSimplify and
obtain the final result I want.  

In my example, the prescription above works however of course it's an
ugly way at the same time...  

Best regards\!
