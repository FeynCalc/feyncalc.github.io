Dear Prffesior,  
               I am a research-fellow at a physics institute of India,  
working on "Finite Temperature Field Theory",and "QGP phenomenology".  
I am trying to use Feyncalc for my calculations but facing some
problems.  
Let me explain them.  
                 At finite temperature the propagators and the
vertices  
loses the simple Lorentz invariant structure and acquires an admixture  
of both spatial and temporal components. Therefore, to perform these  
calculations the programe should be able to recognige both the zeroth  
and spatial components of a four-vector and know should be able to do  
calculations with DiracGamma[0] and
Diracgamma[i],i=1,2,3 explicitly.  
                Can such things be done with feynCalc? Plese let me
know.  
                                        With Regards  
          
                                             Purnendu
