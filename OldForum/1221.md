Hello and, first of all, thanks for the support.  

I was doing some traces in D=4 dimensions and the presence of a GA5
matrix results in a sum Levi-Civita tensors.  
I would like to simplify a bit the expression when expressions of the
following kind appear:  

LC[a,b,c,p] + LC[a,b,c,q] -\> LC[a,b,c,p+q]  

This is not achieved via Simplify[] and I was wondering whether
an existing function performing such a task already exists in FeynCalc
or whether I should do it myself (I could not find any).  

Thanks in advance,  
Pablo
