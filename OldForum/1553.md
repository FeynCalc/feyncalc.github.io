Short answer: Whenever your g^5 prescription violates Ward-Takahashi
and  
Slavnov-Taylor identities, finite counterterms are required to fix  
those. But there is no  
cookbook recipe to calculate the counterterms for arbitrary processes
at  
arbitrary order  
in perturbation theory. Moreover, explicitly checking that all
relevant  
identities are  
satisfied can be also quite cumbersome.  

I'm not an expert on 2HDM so I can't help you here. It usually takes  
some thinking and  
tinkering to check what parts of the calculation are influenced by the  
choice of g^5 scheme, cf. e.g. arXiv:1907.00997

not do this automatically".*
