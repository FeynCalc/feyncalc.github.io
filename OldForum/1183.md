Hi,  

For a particular reason, I want to do a (non-relativistic) calculation
in the Coulomb gauge. I want the PolarizationSum to be the
three-component one, and I want to contract three-dimension Euclidean
indexes. Is this available in the current version? If so, can anyone
tell me how to do it?  

Many thanks,  
Xiaojun
