To Whom it May Concern:  

I am having trouble installing the new version of FeynCalc 4.1. Our  
university (U.W.-Milwaukee) already has a site license for FeynCalc
4.0;  
it is installed on a Mac. I moved the HighEnergyPhysics folder
elsewhere  
and saved the new version in its place. But, when I ran  
\<\<HighEnergyPhysics'fc' as usual, I got a message saying simply
$Failed.  
What could be the problem?  

Thank you,  
Sean Ahern
