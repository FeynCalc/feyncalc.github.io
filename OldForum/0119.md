I'm trying to do an integral that FeynCalc chokes on. The message
returned  
is the usual  

FYI: Tensor integrals of rank higher than 3 encountered; Please use
the  
Â option CancelQP -\> True or OneLoopSimplify-\>True or use another
program.  

However, it appears that CancelQP-\>True is the default, and
OneLoopSimplify  
expresses the results in terms of Contract3, which doesn't seem to
exist.  

The integrals are box diagrams, and a typical term would look something
like  

(k.p1)^3 /
[k^2-lam^2][(k-q)^2-lam^2][(k-p1)^2-m^2][(k+p2)^2-M^2]  

where p1^2=m^2 and p2^2=M^2. This term looks innocent enough, and in
fact  
looks to me like it IS of rank 3. By a lot of fudging and manipulating
I  
managed to get a result using ScalarProductCancel, but it is hit and
miss  
for various terms in the amplitude.  

Is there a fix in FeynCalc, or do I have to use another program (and if
so,  
which one)?
