Dear Francesco,  

judging from  

*\>\> In order to make the option paint work I had to use both my new
.mod .gen and setting the option SetOptions[FourVector,
FeynCalcInternal -\> False];*  
*\>\>*  

I think that you are missing  

FAPatch[PatchModelsOnly -\> True];  

cf. e.g.

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
