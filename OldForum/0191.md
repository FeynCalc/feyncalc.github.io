I am having some issues using the CreateFCAmp function specifically  
specifying the level at which the fields are calculated.  

For various reasons I want to only insert fields at the "{Particles}"
level.  
However when I then run CreateFCAmp on those inserted fields I get an
error  
from CreateFeynAmp. With $VeryVerbose on high it prints  

"creating amplitudes at level(s) {Generic, Classes}"  

and then reports two errors  

"CreateFeynAmp::nolevel: Warning: Level Generic is not contained in
this  
insertion."  
"CreateFeynAmp::nolevel: Warning: Level Classes is not contained in
this  
insertion."  

as the inserted fields at both the Generic and Classes levels are
obviously  
empty. I believe that CreateFeynAmp is supposed to default to the level
at  
which the fields are inserted but that doesn't appear to happen when it
is  
called through CreateFCAmp (No such error results if I call
CreaateFeynAmp  
directly on the inserted fields). I have also tried to force the issue
by  
specifying "AmplitudeLevel -\> {Particles}" as an option for CreateFCAmp
but  
it makes no difference. Any thoughts as to why it behaves like this and
how  
it might be rectified?  

Many thanks,  
Jon Palmer
