Ö÷Ìâ£º How to remove terms of some order  
  
Suppose I have complicated expression with sums, products...etc  
and to simplify my expression I want ro remove terms of some certain
order from denominator...how do I do? I tried simple example but it did
no help:  
[(1/m)+1/m^2][(1/m)+1/m^3] so if I dont want term of
order m^-5 how do I remove it? I tried Simplify[%/.(1/m)^5-
\>0]but.. no result  
  
I do something wrong?
