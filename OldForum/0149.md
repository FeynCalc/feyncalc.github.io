Well, it looks like it is the assignments in the file "QCD/OPEm.m"
that  
are causing the error message. Below follow the suspects  

If you can fix the problem, your'e welcome to commit the fix back.  
I suppose one could use "Greater /:" instead of "Re/:", but I'm not
sure  
it's a good idea mess with a so commonly used function.  

I guess I could use a copy of mma 5.0...  

Cheers, Frederik
