No real problems.  
I patched the non-Phi part of FeynCalc easily some time ago.  
If you want to use FeynArts, it needs a bit of tweeking, but not much.  
If you have Mathematica 6, send me an Email and I give you my patched  
version.  

I am still waiting myself for the final version to get. I only have
the  
latest Release Candidate (kind of beta-version).
