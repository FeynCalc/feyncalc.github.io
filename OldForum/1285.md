Hi,  

if you register yourself for the mailing list following the
instruction  
that appears when you open  

https://feyncalc.github.io/forum  

"Subscribe / unsubscribe by sending an email to  
subscribeATfeyncalc.org/unsubscribeATfeyncalc.org (replace "AT" with
"@"):  
Please write a few words about how you intend to use FeynCalc and put  
your email address in the subject line. Otherwise, we cannot verify
that  
you're not a spammer."  

then you will be able to attach notebooks to your emails here.  

Alternatively, you could just use the GitHub issue tracker,  

https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/issues  

where you also can attach almost anything  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
