Hello,  

I find that in using FermionSpinSum I often get an error message  

"MIST"  

followed by an expression without FermionSpinSum evaluated.  

One example of such an occurrence is when one of the factors inside
FermionSpinSum is a sum of terms, each being a matrix sandwiched between
spinors. But there are also other cases.  

Can you tell me what is going wrong? (And what does MIST mean?)  

Thanks.  

Best regards,  
Saurabh
