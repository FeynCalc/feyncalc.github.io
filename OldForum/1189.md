Thanks for your help.  
Please, find the attached file.  
I hope it was done correctly (drag and drop as I found)  
I have compared plain LoopTools E0 result (note this meanse that this
must be done then for particular numerics or phase space point) and the
5 to 4 point reduction implemented in FeynCalc. In addition, I attached
the necessary Y\_{ij} matrix appearing in the code in case this could
help.  

Best regards,  
Pablo
