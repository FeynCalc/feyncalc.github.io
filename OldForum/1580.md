Hi,  

this sort of questions are usually impossible to answer without a
minimal working example, e.g.  

CreateFeynAmp[DiagramExtract[diags,{n}],PreFactor-\>1]//InputForm  

where n is the number of the diagram that causes troubles  

\+ the code you use to evaluate that diagram.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
