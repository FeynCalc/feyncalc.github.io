You are welcome.  

But I'd be careful with the output of FeynRules, since sometimes  
the obtained Feynman rules may have weird  
glitches (like random opposite signs or pieces missing).  

Either because you missed something in your Lagrangian or  
because FeynRules interpreted your input in a wrong way.  

Checks against results from the literature or own derivations  
are a must.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
