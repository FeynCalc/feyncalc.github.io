Dear Vladyslav,  

I have just noticed you pushed a new commit in github.  
It now works. Thanks for taking care of it\!  

Nevertheless, when installing FeynCalc I'm still getting one of  
the errors I mentioned before,  

Increment::rvalue: FeynCalc\`FAPatch\`Private\`nmodels is not a variable
with a value, so its value cannot be changed.  

It apparently doesn't do anything, I checked it with a few models  
generated by FeynRules. Anyway, should I be worried about?  

Thanks,  
Will
