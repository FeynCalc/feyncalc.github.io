Hi Vladyslav,  
Do you know if there is a simple way to restore the couplings of the
effective theory with 4-fermions operators?  
I mean, If I use an auxiliary field, I get a propagator (even if I would
like to have a constant propagator ) then I have to correct manually
each "auxiliary" propagator and also the factors of 2 coming from the
matching… and also the correct sign for each propagator… and try to
express the amplitude in terms of the coupling of the effective theory.
Then, the probability to make a mistake is very high.  

if you want to have a look, here

you find the model and my notebook that is totally a mess.  

Thank you,  
Francesco
