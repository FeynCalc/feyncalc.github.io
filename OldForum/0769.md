Dear all,  

I would like to report two bugs I encountered in Feyncalc 8.2 (latest  
version). I'm using Mathematica 9, but the bugs are not really related  
to that.  

First of all, in Models/FCQCDLorentz.gen there should be a  
"$FermionLines = True" statement, since otherwise FeynArts generates  
diagrams without Dirac traces and FeynCalc subsequently fails to
compute  
the color trace. This is fixed in Phi, but not in FeynCalc itself.  

Then, in general/Collect3.m, there is a regression bug related to the  
MonomialList function. In FC8.1 there was a condition to use the  
FeynCalc's version of MonomialList for Mathematica below version 6.
For  
some reason this condition was removed in FC8.2. The problem is, that  
Mathematica's built-in MonomialList doesn't have the Option  
"CoefficientDomain -\> RationalFunctions", which makes all functions
that  
rely on Collect3 fail.  

You can easily reproduce the bugs by trying to run  
fcexamples/qcdghostse2loopnew2.nb.  
Because of the missing Dirac traces and the broken MonomialList, the  
computation fails on FC8.2.  

Please find the patch that fixes this problems attached.  

Just in case, I also attach a patch for the FeynArts 3.7, since  
automatic patching doesn't seem to work with Mathematica 9. The patch
is  
just what happens to FA 3.7 after you run  

\<\< "HighEnergyPhysics\`Phi\`Extras\`FAPatch\`"  
$FeynArtsDirectory =  
"/home/YOUR\_USERNAME/.Mathematica/Applications/HighEnergyPhysics/FeynArts-3.7/"  
HighEnergyPhysics\`Phi\`FAPatch\`FAPatch[]  

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------  
If you need to use FeynCalc 8.2 now and you absolutely cannot wait
until  
developers release the new version, here's a quick fix guide on Linux:  

1\) Install fresh Feyncalc via  
    Import["<http://www.feyncalc.org/install.m>"]  
2\) Copy the attached patches to  
\~/.Mathematica/Applications/HighEnergyPhysics  

3\) In the console run  
    cd \~/.Mathematica/Applications/HighEnergyPhysics  
    patch -p0 \< feynarts.patch  
    patch -p0 \< fc82.patch  
4\) Restart Mathematica, run fcexamples/qcdghostse2loopnew2.nb. and
check  
    that you get the same results as in the notebook  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------  

P.S. Correct me if I'm wrong but it looks like in the CVS we still
have  
FC8.1, not FC8.2. Also, with the instructions on  
<http://www.feyncalc.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/> it is impossible to
check  
out the repository :(  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
