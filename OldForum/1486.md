There is no regularization scheme that preserves susy, and there never
will  
be.  
If there were it would probably also prevent anomalies even when they
are  
present.  
Â But according to the BRS ideas we don't need one.  
The question is whether the cohomology has anything that can spoil the
BRS  
identities  
for susy.  

Cheers
