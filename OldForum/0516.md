Dear Dr Mertig  
I have a problem with mathematica version 5.02 for integrating. I used
feyncal and now I have some integrals which mathematica can not solve
them. I am working in D=4-2\*epsilon dimensions which epsilon is smaller
than one.  
for eexample I have this integral:  
(A+B\*x)^(-epsilon)\*(C+D\*x)^(-epsilon)/(x\*Sqrt[E\*x^2+F\*x+H])
or (A+B\*x)^(-epsilon)\*(C+D\*x)^(-epsilon)/(x\*(E\*x^2+F\*x+H)^(3/2))  
where I want to integrate over x.  
I would be gratefull If you help me.  
Best regards  
Moosavi
