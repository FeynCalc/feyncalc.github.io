Dear Friends,  

Somewhy when trying to use Model file "FCQCD"  
as in the example file "qcdgluonse1loop.nb" ,  
I get a message  

InitializeModel::"incomp2":Incompatible  
index structure in classes coupling  
V(5,g1) V(5,g2) V(5, g3) V(5, g4)  
Field V(5,g1) Needs zero indices, not 1.  

Does anybody nows how to solve this ?
