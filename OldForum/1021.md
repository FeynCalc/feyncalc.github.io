Dear FeynCalc users,  

I'd like to announce a small project that I've been working on  
since some time: FeynHelpers  

https://github.com/FeynCalc/feynhelpers  

The idea is to create convenient and easy-to-use interfaces between  
FeynCalc and other Mathematica packages for high energy physics.  
The two currently supported packages are Package X by Hiren Patel (for  
symbolic evaluation of Passarino-Veltman functions with up to 3 legs)  
and FIRE 5 by Alexander Smirnov (for IBP reduction of multi-loop
integrals).  

The user needs to known only two commands:  

PaXEvaluate to call Package X and FIREBurn to call FIRE  

FeynHelpers is still work in progress, in a sense that although the
main  
features are already accessible, it is still a long way to make  
everything sufficiently safe and stable.  

However, the add-on can already be well employed to cross-check
results  
that were obtained using different programs or by hand. If some of you  
could give it a try and report bugs or suggest improvements, this
would  
help a lot.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
