Hi Luca,  

OneLoop is essentially broken since many FeynCalc versions. The
function  
does a lot of weird things (like mixing D- and 4-dimensional tensors)  
which makes the final output rather ambiguous and may easily lead to  
inconsistent result. Especially when the distinction between D and 4  
dimensions is important like in the t'Hooft-Veltman scheme.  

The Dirac algebra related functions (like DiracTrick) impose strict  
checks on those things, so the "sloppiness" of OneLoop leads to a
fatal  
error.  

This is why in the provided examples we use TID which does not suffer  
from these issues.  

I actually even started to rewrite OneLoop, but this is a slow process  
which does not have a very high priority. Eventually it will be
finished  
until the next FeynCalc release.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
