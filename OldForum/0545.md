Yes, you're completely right. The FeynArts loading functionality
that's  
part of the PHI sub-package is unfortunately not compatible with newer  
releases of FeynArts. This is something I may find the time to look
into  
soon...

there are always some incompitable problems. So the best way to use them
is: firstly only use FeynArts to generate amplitude and save them; then
quit kernel, and only install FeynCalc to handle the amplitude.*

(StandardForm doesn't work) to see the actual expression of
amplitude.*
