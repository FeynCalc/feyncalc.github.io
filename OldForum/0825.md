Hi,  

I'm very confused, so any help is appreciated.  

When I evaluate  
Tr[DiracMatrix[a] DiracMatrix[b]
DiracMatrix[c] DiracMatrix[d]]  
I get, as expected  
4 (g^(a d) g^(b c)-g^(a c) g^(b d)+g^(a b) g^(c d))  
Notice that the minus sign is on the term proportional to g^(a c), which
has to be true because the other terms are even permutations of each
other and thus must be symmetric.  

However, upon evaluating  
Tr[DiracMatrix[a] DiracMatrix[\\[Beta]]
DiracMatrix[  
   c] DiracMatrix[\\[Delta]]]  
I get the incorrect answer  
4 (g^(a \\[Delta]) g^(c \\[Beta])-g^(a \\[Beta])
g^(c \\[Delta])+g^(a c) g^(\\[Beta]
\\[Delta]))  
Notice that the minus sign is on the term proportional to g^(a
\\[Beta]) now, which is not how it should be.  

Is this a problem with how Feyncalc understands Greek letters? If so,
this is a big problem, since that is my default when I work by hand and
that is naturally how I input my gamma matrices, but when I turn slashes
into gamma matrices I use the Latin alphabet.  

Any help is appreciated,  
Thanks,  
Sam
