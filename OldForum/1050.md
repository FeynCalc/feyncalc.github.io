Hi,  

first of all, it would be nice to have a minimal working example to  
understand what is going on.  

Second, the fact that GaugeXi[x] may still appear in you
amplitude  
despite using  

GaugeRules -\> {GaugeXi[Z] -\> Infinity, GaugeXi[A] -\>
Infinity,  
Â GaugeXi[W] -\> Infinity}  

is actually mentioned in the FeynArts manual, p. 44  

"Take care that the choices 0 (Landau gauge) and Infinity (unitary  
gauge) actually imply a limit which is in general not correctly taken  
with the naive GaugeRules substitution. In such a case the gauge  
parameters should remain in the amplitude until after simplification,  
and then substituted."  

What you can do, is generate the same amplitude using unpatched
FeynArts  
(\<\<FeynArts\`) on a clean kernel and check if the gauge dependence
is  
still there  

FreeQ[amp,GaugeXi]  

If yes, then it is the standard behavior of FeynArts that one has to  
work around with suitable code.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
