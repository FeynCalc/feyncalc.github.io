Dear Vladyslav,  

Thanks for your prompt reply and fixing the issue of the previous
message.  

I am using FeynHelpers to check IBP relations I have obtained by my
own.  
Moreover, I guess with the latest update of FIRE repository something
didn't go well.  

Let me explain with a particular example.  
For a one-loop box topology, if I define  

FCClearScalarProducts[];  
SPD[p[1], p[1]] = 0;  
SPD[p[2], p[2]] = 0;  
SPD[p[3], p[3]] = 0;  
SPD[p[1], p[2]] = s/2;  
SPD[p[1], p[3]] = -(s + t)/2;  
SPD[p[2], p[3]] = t/2;  

and try to reduce a triangle to bubbles, namely  

int = FAD[q, q - p[1] - p[2], q - p[1] -
p[2] - p[3]]  
int// FIREBurn[\#, {q}, p /@ Range[3]] &  

I get the following error  

FCAbbreviate::failmsg: Error\! FCAbbreviate has encountered a fatal
problem and must abort the computation. The problem reads: Your
expression is too complicated to be abbreviated effectively.  

But, if I don't define the Maldestam variables,  

FCClearScalarProducts[];  
SPD[p[1], p[1]] = 0;  
SPD[p[2], p[2]] = 0;  
SPD[p[3], p[3]] = 0;  

Reduction goes well.  

The file I was doing this check with is an old one that  
worked perfectly with the first releases of Feynhelpers  

I would appreciate if you could tell me how to proceed with  
these troubles.  

Cheers,  
Will
