Dear FeynCalc users,  

in the name of the developer team, let me apologize  
for the spam wave that you were receiving in the last days.  

We had some technical issues with our filtering system that allowed  
everyone to send mails through the mailing list (normally we have a  
white list of allowed senders). These issues are now fixed, so there  
should be no spam anymore. Sorry again for that.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
