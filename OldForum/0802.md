Dear developers:  
SUNSimplify[SUNTrace[SUNT[i, j, i, j]], Explicit -\>
True] just gives -2/3;  
while SUNSimplify[SUNT[i, j, i, j], Explicit -\> True]
gives -2/9.  
why these two differ by a factor "3"?  
In what conditions should I have to use SUNTrace when evaluating QCD
processes?  
For example, when calculating an scalar QCD process(gluon
gluon--\>q0,q0bar),I just evaluate the color factor at last, before that
I just have the squared matrix element equals (\\\!\\(  
\\\*SubsuperscriptBox[\\(g\\), \\(s\\), \\(4\\)]\\ \\((  
\\\*SuperscriptBox[\\(t\\), \\(2\\)]\\  
\\\*SubscriptBox[\\(T\\),
\\(TraditionalForm\\\`\\(TraditionalForm\\\`i\\)\\)] .  
\\\*SubscriptBox[\\(T\\),
\\(TraditionalForm\\\`\\(TraditionalForm\\\`j\\)\\)] .  
\\\*SubscriptBox[\\(T\\),
\\(TraditionalForm\\\`\\(TraditionalForm\\\`j\\)\\)] .  
\\\*SubscriptBox[\\(T\\),
\\(TraditionalForm\\\`\\(TraditionalForm\\\`i\\)\\)] + t\\ u\\  
\\\*SubscriptBox[\\(T\\),
\\(TraditionalForm\\\`\\(TraditionalForm\\\`i\\)\\)] .  
\\\*SubscriptBox[\\(T\\),
\\(TraditionalForm\\\`\\(TraditionalForm\\\`j\\)\\)] .  
\\\*SubscriptBox[\\(T\\),
\\(TraditionalForm\\\`\\(TraditionalForm\\\`i\\)\\)] .  
\\\*SubscriptBox[\\(T\\),
\\(TraditionalForm\\\`\\(TraditionalForm\\\`j\\)\\)] + t\\ u\\  
\\\*SubscriptBox[\\(T\\),
\\(TraditionalForm\\\`\\(TraditionalForm\\\`j\\)\\)] .  
\\\*SubscriptBox[\\(T\\),
\\(TraditionalForm\\\`\\(TraditionalForm\\\`i\\)\\)] .  
\\\*SubscriptBox[\\(T\\),
\\(TraditionalForm\\\`\\(TraditionalForm\\\`j\\)\\)] .  
\\\*SubscriptBox[\\(T\\),
\\(TraditionalForm\\\`\\(TraditionalForm\\\`i\\)\\)] +  
\\\*SuperscriptBox[\\(u\\), \\(2\\)]\\  
\\\*SubscriptBox[\\(T\\),
\\(TraditionalForm\\\`\\(TraditionalForm\\\`i\\)\\)] .  
\\\*SubscriptBox[\\(T\\),
\\(TraditionalForm\\\`\\(TraditionalForm\\\`j\\)\\)] .  
\\\*SubscriptBox[\\(T\\),
\\(TraditionalForm\\\`\\(TraditionalForm\\\`j\\)\\)] .  
\\\*SubscriptBox[\\(T\\),
\\(TraditionalForm\\\`\\(TraditionalForm\\\`i\\)\\)])\\)\\))/(32
s^2)  
At this momente, I just wonder whether I have to use SUNTrace before
SUNSimplify. The answer is yes, only by that can the result match the
correct one. But I don't know why I have to?  
Thanks for the help\!  

Best Regards\!
