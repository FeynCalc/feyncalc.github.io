I'd like to use the PaVeReduce function within FeynCalc in Mathematica  
 to reduce a triangle integral down to bubbles and tadpoles. I found  
 the wolfram help page about this function but I did not find what  
all the options meant with the result that I was unable to produce  
 the reduction I wanted.  

I have used other software for this reduction and I know what the
answer  
 is so I'm just playing about with FeynCalc at the moment. I tried  

     PaVeReduce[C0[0, m^2, m^2/y, 0, 0, m^2]] //
TraditionalForm  

but this didn't do the required reduction. I played about with the
options too in  

     SetOptions[PaVeReduce, A0ToB0 -\> True, BReduce -\> True,
Collecting -\> True, Dimension -\> True, FCVerbose -\> False, Factoring
-\> Factor2, IsolateNames -\> False, Mandelstam -\> {}, PaVeAutoReduce
-\> True, PaVeOrderList -\> {}, WriteOutPaVe -\> True]  

but couldn't get the reduction to go ahead.  

Thanks for any comments\! There is also the possibility that I am
using  
the wrong function because I know that Pass-Velt prescription is
usually  
 done for the reduction of tensor to scalar integrals and I'm trying to
do  
a scalar to sum of simpler scalar integrals reduction.
