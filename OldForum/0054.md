Do you mean Pi0 Proton -\> Pi0 Proton in ChPT ?  

And do you need to calculate it or just look it up?  

In the former case, I can't help you beyound leading order. I have
only  
looked briefly at implementing baryonic ChPT. If you feel like doing
it,  
it would be most welcome :-) The leading order calculation is at:  

<http://www.feyncalc.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/PhiExamples/ChPT/Pions%2bBaryons/>  

In the latter case, depending on to which accuracy and how elaborate
you  
need the calculation, there are a variety of references. Look for  
Meissner+Fettes, Mojzis or Becher+Leutwyler in
