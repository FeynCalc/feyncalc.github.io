I suppose you are using FeynCalc 8.2, since there your example indeed
fails.  

Well, what can I say: FeynCalc 8.2 is like Internet Explorer 6,
outdated  
and full of bugs, but for some reason people still stick to it.  

It would be easier if you could say why your code does not work with
FeynCalc 9.2. In 99% of cases this is something very easy to fix by
changing a few lines. Moreover, I'm all in favor of adding compatibility
options to make old codes work with the newest FeynCalc versions.  

If you prefer to use the version 8.2, then I'm afraid that I can't help
you: The bugs that you report are there, but they have already been
fixed in the newer FeynCalc versions.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
