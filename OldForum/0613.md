I have tryed this with several versions of FeynCalc (4.x and 5.x), on
several machines, with different operating systems (Linux and Windows).
And the results are the same. I try tu reproduce some examples from Help
and it utterly fails.  

For example, if I run  
: PaVe[0,0,{pp},{m^2,M^2}]  
I just get as a result  
\-\> PaVe[0,0,{pp},{m^2,M^2}]  

If I try with DiracTrick  
: DiracTrick[GA[mu,nu,mu]]  
I just get:  
\-\> GA[mu] GA[nu] GA[mu]  
Â (just the expression I have started with)  

If I try to evaluate Trace,  
:
TR[(GSD[p]+m).GAD[\\[Mu]].(GSD[q]-m).GAD[\\[Nu]]]  
I get  
\-\> 4 (m^2 (DiracCanonical-\>False) (Factoring-\>False)
(FeynCalcInternal-\>True) (-g^(\\[Mu] \\[Nu]))
(InsideDiracTrace-\>True)-(DiracCanonical-\>False) (Factoring-\>False)
(FeynCalcInternal-\>True) g^(\\[Mu] \\[Nu])
(InsideDiracTrace-\>True) p\\[CenterDot]q+p^\\[Nu]
q^\\[Mu] (DiracCanonical-\>False) (Factoring-\>False)
(FeynCalcInternal-\>True) (InsideDiracTrace-\>True)+p^\\[Mu]
q^\\[Nu] (DiracCanonical-\>False) (Factoring-\>False)
(FeynCalcInternal-\>True) (InsideDiracTrace-\>True))  

With these bugs, I find the whole package completely unuseful. Is there
anyone alse experiencing this problem? How can that be solved?  

Thank you\!
