I am trying to calculate the trace:  
Tr[GA[mu1].GA[mu2].GA[mu3].GA[mu4].GA[mu5].GA[mu6].GA[5]]
under the setting $West=False, here is what I did:  
$West = False  
Tr[GA[mu1].GA[mu2].GA[mu3].GA[mu4].GA[mu5].GA[mu6].GA[5]]  

FeynCalc returned 0, which is incorrect. I want to know what should I do
to get the expected result.
