Hi\!  
Hello\!  

I have a constant antisymmetric matrix; I would like to write it in
Mathematica and I want that the program to understand it as a constant
which has fixed value; its square equal zero (Taking on consideration
only order one in it).  

Would you please help for declaring this constant in Mathematica\!  

Thanks in advance  
Regards  
Karima
