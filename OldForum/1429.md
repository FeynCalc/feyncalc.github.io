Dear FeynCalc users,  

in the course of preparing the release of the current development  
version, I took  
some time go though the examples, polish them up and introduce some  
systematics  
in the naming of the particles. If you are interested, please have a  
look at  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/tree/master/FeynCalc/Examples
\>  

Most of the example calculations are tree level only, but there are
also  
some interesting computations at 1- or even 2-loops.  

For people who use FeynCalc for educational purposes (i.e. to teach
the  
students do QFT calculations), those simple examples might be useful
and  
helpful.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
