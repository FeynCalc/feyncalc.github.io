Hi,  
    I'm very sorry to made a few mistakes in my previous message. As for
the process on quark gluon scattering, there is a typo when defining the
scalar propagator, ScalarProduct[p] just shouldn't be squared. I
can get the correct answer without using SUNTrace in the last few steps,
SUNSimplify is enough at that stage. I just did a few more related QCD
processes, and I think I have been much more familiar with FeynCalc now.
That is fine.  

Cheers\!
