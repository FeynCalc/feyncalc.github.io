More than 16 years after the original question, the answer is yes, with
FeynCalc 9.3 (aka the current development version) this will be
possible.  

For example (TGA[] is gamma^0, CGA[i] is gamma^i)  

Tr[CGA[i].CGA[j]] (i.e. the trace of two Dirac
matrices with Cartesian indices)  

yields  

\-4 CartesianPair[CartesianIndex[i],
CartesianIndex[j]]  

where CartesianPair[CartesianIndex[i],
CartesianIndex[j]] signifies a Kronecker delta  

Then  

DiracSimplify[TGA[].TGA[]]  

yields 1, since gamma^0 gamma^0 =1, while  

DiracSimplify[CGA[i, j, i, j]] (i.e. g^i g^j g^i g^j  

gives -3  

This still needs some testing, performance improvements and a proper
documentation,  
but this is a work in progress to be completed soon.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
