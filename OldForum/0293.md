Dear K.B. Vijaya Kumar,  
in case you create the AddOns dirctory makd sure  
it is AddOns and not Addons.  

Furthermore  
FileNames["FeynCalc.m",$Path,2]  
should return something (and not an empty list).  
So you might want to add the installation directory  
to $Path, but it should not be necessary if you  
installed it to:  

ToFileName[{$TopDirectory, "AddOns", "Applications",
"HighEnergyPhysics"}]  

Maybe the problem is also the empty space between  
"program files".  
Try to put Mathematica into a different location without  
spaces (you may have to deinstall and reinstall, I don't  
know).  
If this still does not work send me email to  
rolf AT mertig.com.  
Regards,  
Rolf
