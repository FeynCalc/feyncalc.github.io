Hi,  
that was fast\!Thanks very much.  
I see how that works. But maybe I chose a bad example for my problem.  
My real trouble looks more like below. I still cant make that DIFF1
zero.  
Thanks again (and I can fully understand if you dont want to go into
that longer thing were perhaps I made a simple mistake.  

SPdel[a\_, b\_,  
    p\_] := (GS[p] +  
        m).(-MT[a, b] + (1/3)\*  
          GA[a, b] + (1/(3\*m))\*(GA[a]\*FV[p,
b] -  
              GA[b]\*FV[p, a]) + (2/(3\*m^2))\*FV[p,
a]\*FV[p, b])  
\\[CapitalLambda]a[a\_, b\_, c\_] := (g1/2)\*MT[a,
b]\*GA[5, c]  

T1 = SPdel[\\[Beta], \\[Gamma],  
      p2].\\[CapitalLambda]a[\\[Gamma],
\\[Epsilon], \\[CapitalOmega]1].SPdel[\\  
\\[Epsilon], \\[Delta], p1]  

DR1 = DiracReduce[T1];  
DR2 = DiracReduce[  
        SPdel[\\[Beta], \\[Gamma],  
          p2]].DiracReduce[\\[CapitalLambda]a[\\[Gamma],
\\[Epsilon], \\  
\\[CapitalOmega]1]].DiracReduce[SPdel[\\[Epsilon],
\\[Delta], p1]];  
DR3 = DiracReduce[DR2];  
DIFF1 = DR1 - DR3;
