thanks for your mail. Actually, this bug was already fixed on the 6th
of  
December last year  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/commit/1426ca2dcb2d93cdf833d39ab55d70662641a243\>  

As explained in  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/wiki/Installation\#stable\_version\>  

the stable version receives bug fixes via the hotfix-stable branch on  
GitHub, so it is always worth checking  

https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/tree/hotfix-stable  

from time to time and reinstalling FeynCalc via  

Import["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/master/install.m"]  
InstallFeynCalc[]  

In the latest stable version ToPaVe can handle any number of legs,  
according the Denner's formula in the appendix of Appendix A of  
arXiv:1604.06792, so things like  

ToPaVe[FAD[{q, m1}, {q + p1, m2}, {q + p2, m3}, {q + p3, m4}, {q
+ p4,  
     m5}, {q + p5, m6}], q]  

or  

ToPaVe[FAD[{q, m1}, {q + p1, m2}, {q + p2, m3}, {q + p3, m4}, {q
+ p4,  
     m5}, {q + p5, m6}, {q + p6, m7}], q]  

also work.  

*\>*  
*\> Second, if using OneLoop[] to evaluate the E0 scalar
function instead, FeynCalc decomposes in terms of the corresponding
4-point (D0) functions. However, I obtain numerically the opposite sign
that I obtain using the 'Denner Dittmaier'
(doi:10.1016/S0550-3213(03)00184-6) algorithm to decompose in terms of
D0 functions myself or either LoopTools.*  
*\> I would appreciate if you could possibly explain where the reduction
of E0 to D0's is located in FeynCalc in order to (possibly) check on the
sign.*  
*\>*  

\*Sigh\* I usually recommend people not to use OneLoop, as this
function  
turns out to be an infinite source of bugs...  

Furthermore, one has to keep in mind that the E0 reduction used in  
OneLoop is valid only when IR divergences are regularized with fake  
masses, but not dimensionaly. However, this also applies to the paper  
that you are referring to, so I guess that you are aware of that.  

Anyhow, the reduction implemented in OneLoop uses Eq. 4.54 from  

https://arxiv.org/pdf/0709.1075.pdf  

In the development version (master branch) I recently extracted that  
piece of code from OneLoop and moved it into
LoopIntegrals/NPointTo4Point.m  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/blob/master/FeynCalc/LoopIntegrals/NPointTo4Point.m\>  

You can switch to the development version via  

Import["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/master/install.m"]  
InstallFeynCalc[InstallFeynCalcDevelopmentVersion -\> True]  

Could you provide some detailed examples where you believe that the  
overall(?) sign is incorrect? Then I could look into it in the next  
couple of days.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
