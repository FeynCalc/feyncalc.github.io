Hi,  

I've encountered some strange behaviour using OneLoopSimplify. The
following code is problematic:  

OneLoopSimplify[ FVD[p, \\[Mu]] SPD[p, k]
FAD[{p}, {p, m}], p]  

The output is zero. However, if you factor out the vector k (which of
course is a constant in this integration) and therefore evaluate  

OneLoopSimplify[ FV[p, \\[Mu]] FV[p,
\\[Nu]] FAD[{p}, {p, m}], p]  

the result is the expected non-zero stuff: the metric tensor/ (D (p^2 -
m^2)).  

I'm using FeynCalc 6.0.0 under mathematica 6.  

If there is a work around that would be great (and apologies if I am
just stupid.)  

Donal.
