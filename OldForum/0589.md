Unfortunatly, no.  

The examples given in the manuals are just for the specific command.
There is no such thing as a short, but complete calculation of some
simple process.  

I am looking for some example for months now, and with no luck. Just
simple example, but complete one.  

I am having troubles with the simplest commands like HelicityME or
SquaredME. Without an example, I don't know how to use them properly
(practical sintax)
