Well, in principle there are infinitely many ways to obtain wrong  
results by using wrong syntax, so it would take a lot of work to put  
warning signs around all potential pitfalls.  

But at least in your case it shouldn't be that difficult to catch  
missing dots. So I added this to the development version  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/commit/bff5ac64a6fb909a6be5610d7a2094a58b4fa86a\>  

It is not a silver bullet and is very basic, but at least things like  

TR[GA[a]GA[b]GA[c]GA[d]] or
TR[GA[a,b]GA[c,d]] or
TR[GA[a,b]GA[c]]  

now generate  

DiracTrace::noncom: Wrong syntax\! The Dirac trace of xxx  
contains Dirac matrices multiplied via Times (commutative  
multiplication) instead of DOT (non-commutative multiplication).  
Evaluation aborted\!  

Hope that helps.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav

sometimes I don't, and I didn't realize it was so crucial. It is a
little worrisome that there is no error message: it evaluates either
way, but sometimes with the wrong answer.*
