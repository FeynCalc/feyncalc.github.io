Hi,  

the option EpsContract is responsible solely for the contractions of two
epsilon tensors  

Contract[LC[mu, nu][p1, p2] LC[mu,
nu][p3, p4]]  

Contract[LC[mu, nu][p1, p2] LC[mu,
nu][p3, p4], EpsContract -\> False]  

The contractions of 4-vectors with epsilon tensors are automatic and
cannot be disabled in Contract. I wouldn't know why one would like to do
that. The notation of an epsilon tensor with momenta instead of indices
is standard in theoretical HEP codes (e.g. in FORM) since many years.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav

the four-vector index and Levi-Civita, although I changed it as
