Hi,  

sorry for the late reply. I'm not sure that I understand your
question.  

You can write down any standard model amplitude using the basic  
FeynCalc objects like four vectors, metric tensors, propagators and  
Dirac or color matrices and then evaluate it. You also can generate
the  
diagrams using FeynArts and then convert it to FeynCalc and evaluate  
that. For the external W-boson you of course need to insert the
correct  
polarization sum, but it is trivial to write a replacement rule for  
that. There are examples for doing these kind of things:

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
