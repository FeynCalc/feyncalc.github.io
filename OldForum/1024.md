Hi Wen-Long,  

I'm not very familiar with Fortran, but to me this  
looks like just the D notation for DOUBLE PRECISION  
type, i.e. 8D0 = 8. 10^0 = 8. etc.  

You can disable it using the FortranDoublePrecision option:  

Write2["sang.abc", abc = 0.6\*(-8 + 12 Log[5 +
y[1]]),  
 abc1 = 1/x^(2/3), FormatType -\> FortranForm,  
 FortranFormatDoublePrecision -\> False]  

which returns  

        abc = 0.6\*(-8. + 12.\*Log[5. + y[1.]])  
        abc1 = x^(-0.6666666666666666)  

Is this what you would like to have?  

P.S. The bug is actually that Mathematica 10 ignores the option  
FortranDoublePrecision, thus always returning the result without D's,  
while versions 8 and 9 behave in a correct way. I'll fix that asap.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
