Dear Luka,  

so far I don't see a problem with your result. For  

res = (PaVe[1, 2, {p10, p12, p20}, {m02, m12, m22}] -  
    PaVe[1, 2, {p20, p12, p10}, {m02, m22, m12}]) //  
  PaVeReduce // Simplify  

I obtain  

((m02 - m12) B0[0, m02, m12] + (-m02 + m22) B0[0, m02,  
     m22] + (m12 - m22) B0[0, m12, m22])/(p10^2 + (p12 -
p20)^2 -  
   2 p10 (p12 + p20))  

Inserting explicit results for B0's  

sols = {B0[0, m02, m12] -\>  
  1/(16 Epsilon \\[Pi]^4) + (-m02 Log[m02/  
      m12] + (m02 - m12) (1 + Log[ScaleMu^2/m12]))/(  
   16 (m02 - m12) \\[Pi]^4),  
 B0[0, m02, m22] -\>  
  1/(16 Epsilon \\[Pi]^4) + (-m02 Log[m02/  
      m22] + (m02 - m22) (1 + Log[ScaleMu^2/m22]))/(  
   16 (m02 - m22) \\[Pi]^4),  
 B0[0, m12, m22] -\>  
  1/(16 Epsilon \\[Pi]^4) + (-m12 Log[m12/  
      m22] + (m12 - m22) (1 + Log[ScaleMu^2/m22]))/(  
   16 (m12 - m22) \\[Pi]^4)};  

via (res/.sols)//PowerExpand//Simplify  

I indeed get 0, as it should be. Please let me know, if you get  
something else.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav

Naimely, one should expect the Passarino-Veltman function C\_{12} to be
symmetric with respect to the replacement p1 \<-\> p2 and m1 \<-\> m2,
according to its definition.*
