Dear Mr or Mrs  
When I load FeynCalc and FeynArts in a same notebook to generate Feynman
diagrams and feynman amplitude by FeyArts and then simplify feynman
amplitude by Feycalc, there are some warning and some commands don't
work. I have tried some different versions of FeyCalc and FeynArts
downloading from homepage, but I still failed. The tries also include
loading FeynArts directly by "\<\<" and indirectly by
"$LoadFeynArts=True". What is the difference between the directly load
and indirectly load? I am confused about it. I wonder whether FeynCalc
and FeynArts couldn't work togther in a same nb. Could you help me?  

My paltform is windowsXP and my mathematica is 5.2 students version  
The Feyarts and FeyCalc are unpacked separately in
dir"..\\Mathematica\\5.2\\AddOns\\Applications"
