Hi,  

thanks for reporting this and sorry for the late reply (I'm on a  
conference right now). There is an issue with ScalarProductCancel,
where  
sometimes it fails to cancel all the scalar products, that can be  
cancelled. I was trying to fix this in a "non-invasive" way, but it  
seems like to get rid of this problem once and for all, I need to  
rewrite the internal logic of SPC almost from scratch, as it was done  
for TID and Tdec. However, since SPC is used by many other functions I  
will need some time for additional tests.  

As a workaround, for now you can use TID (from the latest git snapshot  
with today's commits). With the option UsePaVeBasis set to True it
will  
reduce tensor integrals to PaVe scalar functions just as OneLoop does.  
The purely scalar integrals can be converted to A0, B0, C0 etc. via  
ToPaVe. For example:  

TID[test1, q] // ToPaVe[\#, q] &  

or  

TID[test1, q, UsePaVeBasis -\> True] // ToPaVe[\#, q]
&  

The first one is the full reduction into the PaVe scalar integrals  
A0,B0,C0,D0. The second one is for the case that you choose your  
kinematics such, that there will be vanishing Gram determinants.  
This is also more close to what OneLoop does.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
