Hi Vladyslav,  

Today, I update FeynCalc in my computer. However, one problem is
encountered.  

I generate the SM model file from FeynRules. It can be used in FeynArts,
but not the patched FeynArts with FeynCalc. The details are described
below:  

My computer information:  
OS: Mac OS X 10.9.5  
MMA: 8.0.0.0  
FeynRules:2.3.19  

Case I:  
FeynCalc: 9.0.1  
FeynArts: 3.9  
The FeynCalc is installed by the automatic command in the FeynCalc wiki.
During the installation process, FeynArts is automatically installed and
patched.  

Case II:  
FeynArts: 3.9  
Just downloaded from FeynArts website.  

I generate the FeynArts model files “SM\_Unitary\_Gauge.mod” and
“SM\_Unitary\_Gauge.gen” in FeynRules with the default SM model file
SM.fr. Then, I load the model file in FeynArts using the command  

InitializeModel["SM\_Unitary\_Gauge", GenericModel -\>
"SM\_Unitary\_Gauge”]  

In case II, It’s OK. In case I, however, I get an error:  

TagSetDelayed::tagnf: "Tag FourVector not found in
-Overscript[mom\_, \_]^mu\_”.  

Maybe, the reason is that some codes of FeynArts are not correctly
patched in FeynRules 9.0.1. Could you please check if it is a bug? I
upload the relevant files in the link  

https://www.dropbox.com/s/u4w19pwpdnv4cjq/debug\_FeynRules\_9.0.1.zip?dl=0  

Thank you for your time.  

Best Regards,  
Xing-Bo Yuan
