Last month I finally modified the behavior of ComplexConjugate, such  
that now dummy indices are renamed automatically  

https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/commit/d7708286ef299bbb26ebed7d12f8737c3b02517a  

c.f.  

GA[mu, mu]  
ComplexConjugate[GA[mu, mu]]  

also  

test = SpinorUBar[k2, m2].GA[mu].SpinorV[k1, m2]
SpinorU[p1, m1].GA[  
     mu].SpinorVBar[p2, m1]
FeynAmpDenominator[PropagatorDenominator[s]]  
ctest = ComplexConjugate[test]  
(FermionSpinSum[test ctest] /. DiracTrace -\> Tr) // Contract  

One can turn that off via ComplexConjugate[exp,  
FCRenameDummyIndices-\>False], of course. I hope that this  
change would lower the number of wrong results obtained when squaring  
the amplitude and forgetting to apply FCRenameDummyIndices.  

The examples were also modified accordingly. Currently this change is  
only in the development version, but will become standard in the next  
stable release.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav

*\> The problem here might come from (im not at a computer with FC) the
fact that you have GA[mu] listed 4 times in the FSS. So when you
have :*  
*\>*  
*\> (ub.GA[mu].u).(vb.GA[mu].v)*  
*\>*  
*\> and take the complex conjugate, it doesnt relabel the indices. I
always do something like:*  
*\>*  
*\> AMP = (SpinorUBar[k2, m2].GA[mu].SpinorV[k1,
m2]) (SpinorU[p1, m1].GA[*  
*\> mu].SpinorVBar[p2, m1]);*  
*\>*  
*\> AMPSQ =
FermionSpinSum[Calc[AMP.ComplexConjugate[AMP/.{mu-\>
nu}]]]/.DiracTrace-\> Tr*  
*\>*  
*\> As my standard squared amplitude.*  
*\>*  
*\> Also I use the "." a lot, and Calc[A.A\*] before the FSS.*
