Hi Vladyslav,  

many thanks for all the hard work here in Feyncalc forum.  

I'm having some problems with gamma5 in d dimensions. I know gamma5  
only makes sense at 4 dimensions; nonetheless, I need to evaluate some  
1-loop amplitudes in dimensional regularization, and it turns out that  
those amplitudes involve gamma5.  

So I get two different error messages. One of them stems from my  
attempt to do a Contract involving d-dimensional gamma matrices and  
gamma5; "The problem reads: Incorrect combination of dimensions and  
g^5 scheme\!". The second one is equivalent, with the exception that  
instead of a Contract, I am trying to compute a trace; "the problem  
reads: Irregular trace structure in (...)".  

I already tried some solutions (not successful, though). About the  
first problem: I read that you suggest using TID instead of OneLoop;  
but I don't know how to make TID compute the loop integral (as OneLoop  
usually does). About the second one: I found out that one needs an  
additional prescription (in order to avoid troubles with gamma 5). So  
I chose the BHMV scheme; but the problem remains.  

Any suggestions?  

Thanks in advance,  
Duarte
