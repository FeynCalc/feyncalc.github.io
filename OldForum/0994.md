Hi,  

sorry for the late reply, at the moment I'm working on a larger update  
to FeynCalc with some nice features.  

In general, OneLoop is a sort of legacy function with a lot of code
that  
is used only there and nowhere else. It seems that it is not able to
do  
the tensor decomposition correctly, if OneLoop is not allowed to
cancel  
scalar products beforehand (CancelQP-\>True).  

To avoid this issue, I will remove the CancelQP option. I also
recommend  
you to use TID instead:  

TID[SP[q1, q1] FAD[{q1, m1}, {q1 + kk1, m2}, {q1 + kk2,
m3}], q1]  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
