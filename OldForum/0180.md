Dear FeynCalc users,  

Frederik and I are happy to announce the release of FeynCalc 5 beta 1.  
Go to <http://www.feyncalc.org/download/> to get it.  

Here a short list of new features:  

\- FeynCalc 5 beta 1 is fully compatible with Mathematica 5.0  
\- simplified installation (you can put it anywhere on your harddisk and
just load by, say  
\<\</tmp/HighEnergyPhysics/FeynCalc.m )  
\- full integration with FeynArts (i.e., a slightly patched version of
FeynArts is included,  
which we redistribute with kind permission from Th. Hahn,  
   the current deveoper of FeynArts )  
\- fully worked out examples in the HighEnergyPhysics/fcexamples
directory (more to come  
later)  
\- improved TARCER version, also complelety integrated with FeynCalc  
\- improved contraction speed  
\- improved Phi (also complelety integrated)  
\- improved database function CheckDB  
\- new function CalcColorFactor  

Please send any bug reports, comments and suggestions.  
We will address them, maybe sometimes not immediately, but we will.  

Enjoy\!  

Rolf Mertig
