Apparently Mathematica 11 is too sloppy when checking the syntax, as  
compared to Mathematica 8...  

Anyhow, I found the issue and fixed it in the development version (in  
the stable version there is no separate EpsEvaluate function)  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/commit/5f3031ee1a1ae3a693c48e1fd554a8c76fb9dc7d\>  

So if you reinstall again Mathematica 8 should not complain anymore.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
