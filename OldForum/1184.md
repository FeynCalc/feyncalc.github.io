Hi,  

unfortunately, FeynCalc is not really suitable for non-relativistic  
calculations as there is no built-in support for Cartesian/Euclidean  
indices.  

You could try to code something on top of FeynCalc to suit your needs,  
but that will probably take quite some time, i.e. there is no fast and  
simple solution.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav

tell me how to do it?*
