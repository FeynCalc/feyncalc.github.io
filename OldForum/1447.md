Hi,  

I've got my matrix element from FeynCalc. As far as I know, FeynCalc
does not do the phase space integration. So any recommended tools that I
can put my matrix element into and do the (3-body) phase space
integral?  

(You might suggest me to use some numerical tools like MadGraph from
generating the process to finally doing phase space integral. However,
the matrix element was after some artificial modifications for which
MadGraph is very hard to do. So modifying the matrix element in FeynCalc
in advance seems a better choice.)  

Thanks so much\!  

Best regards,
