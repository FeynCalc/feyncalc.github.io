Hello,  
 I was wondering if anyone has any experience with using MathCode C++,
in particular if it works with FeynCalc. According to the developers of
MathCode it is supposed to dramatically speed up the execution of code
written in Mathematica by generating a stand-alone C++ code. I will
appreciate any comments, since I'm currently thinking of extending some
of my projects with FeynCalc, but still in doubts since it will be
extremely slow with the current speed of Mathematica.  

Best Regards:
