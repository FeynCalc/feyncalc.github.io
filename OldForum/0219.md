Greetings\! Just a thought here -- luckily all this is on top of lisp,  
and, in principle, its 'code is data' feature would allow one to write  
a walker which would generate a list of invocations guaranteed to  
trigger every branch, or even specified levels of branch  
combinations. Someone told me once they've seen such a walker for a  
certain application, so the idea is not completely vaporware, but I'd  
imagine the test list would grow exponentially quite quickly.  

Just a thought.  

Take care,
