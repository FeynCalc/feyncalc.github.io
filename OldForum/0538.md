If you tell about fixed value of some 4-vecor or tensor component you
assume to deal with some concrete reference system, may be C.M. or
Lab-system. In FC you deal with Lorentz invariants. You can calculate
the value of LeviCivita tensor (contracted with four 4-vectors) in any
system by hands and furthermore to substitute it into FC-calculation.
