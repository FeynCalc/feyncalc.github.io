Dear FeynCalc users,  

we've been granted access to GitHub's beta for the new Discussions
feature,  
which offers a convenient and modern forum for questions and
discussions:  

https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/discussions  

Therefore, we would like to ask you to use Discussions for your future  
inquiries  
regarding FeynCalc and to post apparent bugs in Issues  

https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/issues  

Our mid- to long-term goal would be to shut down the current mailing  
list and use  
Discussions as our main communication tool. Of course, we will find a  
way to preserve  
the old messages on the mailing list, so that they do not get lost and  
still can be accessed  
in the future.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
