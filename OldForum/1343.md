Dear Vladyslav,  

I was trying to install the latest development version of FeynCalc
together  
with FeynHelpers and I encountered the following warning message:  

Increment::rvalue: FeynCalc\`FAPatch\`Private\`nmodels is not a variable
with a value, so its value cannot be changed.  

As well, if I load FeynCalc+FeynHelpers, I get two warning messages  

Global\`$FeynCalcStartupMessages::shdw: Symbol $FeynCalcStartupMessages
appears in multiple contexts {Global\`,FeynCalc\`}; definitions in
context Global\` may shadow or be shadowed by other definitions.  

FeynCalc::context: FeynCalc has detected strange objects in the Global
or FeynCalc contexts.  

New lowercase objects in the Global context:
{Global\`$FeynCalcStartupMessages}  

If I don't load FeynHelpers, everything goes well.  

I would be extremely thankful if you could have a look  
at these possible bugs.  

Cheers,  
Will
