Dear FeynCalc users,  

FeynCalc 9.2 is now official. This time there are not so many visible  
changes, but quite few improvements under the hood (especially for  
DiracTrace). The changelog can be found here  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/blob/master/FeynCalc/Changelog.md\>  

It is recommended to use the automatic installer to install or update  
FeynCalc:  

Import["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/master/install.m"]  
InstallFeynCalc[]  

Many thanks to all the people who made suggestions and reported bugs
or  
inconsistencies.  

Have fun\!  

Best regards,  
FeynCalc Developer Team
