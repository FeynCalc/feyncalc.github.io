Correct. In fact, I haven't thought of the possibility that someone  
would use FCFAConvert[] for unpatched FeynArts. However, this
shouldn't  
be difficult to fix.  

I don't use FeynRules, so it would be nice if you could send me some  
examples of code to which you are applying FCFAConvert. This way I
could  
it test it a bit, before pushing the changes in the repo.  

Cheers,
