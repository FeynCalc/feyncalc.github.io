1\) That  

Spinor[-Momentum[p5], M5, 1]  

is displayed like  

v[-p5, M5]  

when it stands at the beginning of a Dot product, seems to be a decision
of Rolf's, for which I'm sure he has his reasons.  

That the mass argument is not displayed is a bug, which has been fixed.
The fix will be in the next release together with many other fixes.  

2\) Was not a problem with FeynCalcForm, but with ComplexConjugate. Has
been reported before and fixed. See
<[0001.html](0001.html)>. I saw it only on the command
line because there I was using an old version without the fix.  

New version will be uploaded as soon as possible.
