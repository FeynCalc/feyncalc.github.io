To clarify a bit on the sign convention:  

1\) FCPrepareFAAmp (which is the new default function  
   for converting FeynArts output to FeynCalc input) doesn't  
   change any signs in the original FeynArts expression  

2\) For the sign conventions used in FeynArts, see here  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/wiki/FAQ\#fasigns\>  

This is of course true only as long as you use the default models  
distributed with FeynArts. For custom models the sign convention can
be  
really quite arbitrary.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
