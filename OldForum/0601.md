Hello,  

I guess this i a good occasion to bring PHI and perhaps FeynCalc in  
general up to date with the new versions of FeynArts and Mathematica.  

I'm assuming you're trying to get the notebooks from  

<http://www.feyncalc.org/phi/examples/ChPT/Weak/>  

to run - is this correct?  

Could you inform me what version of Mathematica and FeynArts you're  
using and on which platform?  

Best regards,  
Frederik
