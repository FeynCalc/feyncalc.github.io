Hello,  
the documentation will not show up in Mathematica 6.  
It is some work to get this done and I have neither time nor  
funding to do so.  
Maybe an ambitious student would want to do this.  
Here is a link on how to get started with the Help system  
of Mathematica 6, the so-called "Documentation center" :  
<http://www.scientificarts.com/worklife/notebooks/>
