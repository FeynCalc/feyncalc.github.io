Hi,  

there were some issues with ApartFF in the stable  
version that were fixed in the development version some time  
ago  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/commit/1225fe13db977a3b834e4867e7d55aa3d523a5bb\>  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/commit/d48a409bbb887357013cd930644f89cf39b73659\>  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/commit/8e859cbe1c3cb24cd1fb6b717781690baa04f3e3\>  

since those fixes also involved changing the default  
behavior of ApartFF (now scaleless integrals are set to zero  
in D-dims) they didn't make it into the stable version.  

With the development version your code works returning  

\-(FAD[{q1, m}, -p + q1, {-k - 2 p + q1, m}]/(2 (m^2 -
SPD[p, p]))) -  
 FAD[{q1, m}, {k + q1, m}, -p + q1]/(2 (m^2 - SPD[p,
p])) +  
 FAD[{q1, m}, {k + q1, m}, {-2 p + q1, m}]/(m^2 - SPD[p,
p])  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
