A follow-up on this 5-year old question: With FeynCalc 9.3 one can  
input such scalar product using SP (or SPD), \*if\* the c-numbers  
a and b are declared to have DataType FCVariable:  

DataType[a, FCVariable] = True;  
DataType[b, FCVariable] = True;  
SP[a p1, b p2] // ExpandScalarProduct  

yields  

a b Pair[Momentum[p1], Momentum[p2]]  

as expected.  

Cheers
