hi -  

after following the steps given in the installation docu, i get the
message  

Could not find FeynCalc installation. Quitting the Mathematica kernel.  

i put the package in .Mathematica/Applications/, so that there is a
directory HighEnergyPhysics, and tried  

<<HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`  

??
