Hello, I'm trying to use Feyncalc 9.3 to do some tree level calculations
in unitary gauge but I cannot seem to get it to work correctly.  

Â Let's say I am just looking at the Z exchange diagrams for WW-\>WW
scattering. Each of these should have a Z propagator that looks like \~
(g\_{\\mu,\\nu} - k\_{\\mu}k\_{\\nu}/mz^{2}) in unitary gauge. However
even with unitary gauge loaded, the amplitudes returned by feyncalc only
include the g\_{\\mu,\\nu} pieces.  

I have tried using examples that are included and all of these
amplitudes have the same problem.  

Thank you.
