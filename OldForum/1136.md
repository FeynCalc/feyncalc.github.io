Dear Vladyslav,  

I am using FC 9.2.0 to calculate H -\> ZZ in the SM at one-loop level.
However, I got the error message when I use OneLoop[amp, q] or
TID[amp, q], where q is defined as the LoopMomenta and amp is
the Feynman amplitude:  

FDS::failmsg: Error\! FDS has encountered a fatal problem and must abort
the computation.  

The problem reads: fdsOneLoop couldn't be applied to some of the unique
integrals.  

I found some information in  
https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/blob/master/FeynCalc/LoopIntegrals/FeynAmpDenominatorSimplify.m  

but I do not know how to deal with it. I have some experience with 8.x
and 9.0.0  

Thanks a lot.  
Gang Li
