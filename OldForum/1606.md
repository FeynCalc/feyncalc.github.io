Dear Paulina,  

if it is a big expression, then please isolate  
the minimal relevant piece that generates the error.  
This should be easy enough e.g. as in  

longExpression = Sum[a[i], {i, 1, 1000}];  

longExpression[[1 ;; 500]] // fun;  

longExpression[[1 ;; 250]] // fun;  
longExpression[[20 ;; 250]] // fun;  

until you get the smallest number of terms between  
the lower and the upper bounds.  

Once you are done with that, please provide me with  
the output of  

yourExp // FCE // InputForm  

so that I can properly paste it into a Mathematica notebook.  

I mean, if I can't reproduce the issue on my computer,  
then I can't help understanding why it happens.  
But for that I don't need to see your full calculation, just  
some small piece that generates the error.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
