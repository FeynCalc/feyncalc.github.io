Hi,  

thanks a lot for having patched FeynArts 3.7 with FeynCalc 8.  

However, I experience a trouble when I use the InsertionField[]
functions with common SM topologies like simple boxes. This does not
happen when I use the FeynArts 3.4  
patched version.  

The error message reads :  

TagSetDelayed::tagnf: \\\\\\"Tag FourVector not found in
-mom\_^mu\_\_\_.\\\\\\"  

Thank you for any answer.  

Sincerly,  

Philippe Mertens
