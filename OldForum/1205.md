Hi Vladyslav,  

I seem to get a different result for a trace with an even number of
gamma5's using Larin's prescription ($Larin = True) as compared to the
naive anticommuting scheme: (I am using FeynCalc 9.2.0)  

In[1]:=
trace:=Tr[GAD[mu].DiracMatrix[5].GAD[mu].DiracMatrix[5]]  

In[2]:=  
$Larin = False;  
trace  
Out[2]:= -4D  

In[3]:=  
$Larin = True;  
trace  
Out[3]:= -(2/3) (D-3) (D-2) (D-1) D  

The results differ for D\!=4. The reason may be that with the Larin's
prescription implemented in FeynCalc,
GAD[mu].DiracMatrix[5] at the end of the trace is first
replaced by the LeviCivita tensor with three gamma's, and the resulting
trace with the remaining gamma5 gives another LeviCivita. Then the
contraction of the two tensors is done treating them as D-dimensional.
This gives something different to what you will get putting gamma5's
together in the first place.  

I can of course avoid the problem by separating traces with odd and even
number of gamma5's, and using NDR on the latter. But sometimes (this was
my case) one carelessly writes the expression for the full trace, and
one expects that terms with even number of gamma5's will be the same no
matter which prescription has been set. Is there a way to set Larin's
gamma5 scheme in FeynCalc to avoid the issue above?  

Thanks for your support of FeynCalc\!  

Pedro
