Hi.  

Thanks for reporting the bug. It should be fixed now (  
<http://www.feyncalc.org/download/HighEnergyPhysics.tar.gz> or just  
<http://www.feyncalc.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/HighEnergyPhysics/FeynCalc.m>
).  
Please check. Could you also remind me who and when this was reported  
previously - I can't find it in <http://www.feyncalc.org/forum/>.  

Regards, Frederik Orellana
