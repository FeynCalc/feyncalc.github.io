Hello,  
I am trying to use FeynArts with FC 8.2 in Mathematica 9, and it seems
to be included in the package but when I try  
$LoadPhi = True;  
$LoadFeynArts = True;&\#65533;&\#65533;  
<<HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`  

I get this error:  
WARNING\! Your FeynArts installation is not complete or the version you
have cannot be used with this version of FeynCalc.  
FeynArts not found.  

But FeynArts-3.7 is in the HighEnergyPhysics directory, is there
anything else that needs to be done?  

Thanks\!  
Ralph
