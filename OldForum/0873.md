There is actually a nice Mathematica Package from H. Patel, that came
out recently  

https://packagex.hepforge.org/  

and contains a lot of explicit analytic results for A0, B0 and C0
depending on the kinematic configuration. While A0 and B0 are indeed
easy and can be done by hand, in case of C0 it is very nice to have some
sort of a library for cases with nice kinematics (i.e. all masses are
the same or most of the external momenta vanish). The D0 results are
unfortunately not included but as far as I understand the author might
add it in future.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
