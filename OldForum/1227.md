Hi,  

thanks for reporting this.  

This is a bug related to the internal caching of DiracTrace: once the  
calculated traces are cached with a particular value of
$LeviCivtaSign,  
setting it to something else does not change the cached results.  

Should be now fixed in the stable and in the the development versions.  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/commit/b4bdb78fe3404dad3b5f67bb13332996047080fb\>  

Please reinstall the stable version via the automatic installer.  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
