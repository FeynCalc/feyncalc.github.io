Dear FeynCalc mailing list subscribers.  

Because of unreasonable amounts of spam, mails directly to
[feyncalc_at_HIDDEN-E-MAIL]
will no longer be accepted. Please use the web interface at  

<[index.html](index.html)>  

Because of this change, a few emails may not have reached your mailbox.
They are on the web page though.  

This change means that you will no longer get any spam from here.  

Thanks for your interest in FeynCalc.  

Rolf and Frederik
