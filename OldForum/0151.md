I'm also getting the same error messages:  

DownValues::vlist : Cannot set \\\!  
\\(TraditionalForm\\?\\(DownValues[  
HighEnergyPhysics\`FeynCalc\`DataType\`DataType ]\\)\\)  
to &\#171;l&\#187;; value must be a list of rules.  

I use WinXP, Mathematica 4.1 and have tried both FeynCalc 4.1.1.0 and
4.2.0. When I select "Rebuild Help Index" in Mathematica, the help
browser opens, but doesn't have any mention of Feyncalc.  

Any ideas how to fix my install?
