As far as I can see there's nothing wrong with DiracOrder.  

What's happening is just that (see
<http://www.feyncalc.org/Polarization/index.html>) the contraction of a
momentum frou-vector and the corresponding polarization vector is
automatically set to zero.  

That is, transversality is assumed. If you don't want that, use some
other name than Polarization[...] for the polarization vector.  

Hope this helps.
