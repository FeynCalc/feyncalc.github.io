You can, e.g., install it into your home directory (or any other  
directory which is on $Path).  

It is recommended to do additionally:  

Export[ToFileName[{$PreferencesDirectory, "Kernel"},
"init.m"],  
  "(\*\* User Mathematica initialization file
\*\*)\\nSetOptions[$FrontEnd,\\"CommonDefaultFormatTypes\\" -\>
{\\"Output\\"-\>StandardForm}];\\n", "Text"]his  

Regards,  

Rolf
