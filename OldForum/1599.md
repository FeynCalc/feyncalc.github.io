Dear all,  

I am new to FeynCalc and I want to use it to calculate NLO cross section
for new Physics. I have my .fr rules which I used to generate UFO and
FeynArts model files. Now I need to do something analytically.  

In order to make the option paint work I had to use both my new .mod
.gen and setting the option SetOptions[FourVector, FeynCalcInternal
-\> False];  

In my model the SM is embedded so I was learning and testing it with
some know process like qg-\>qg scattering at LO
(https://feyncalc.github.io/FeynCalcExamplesMD/QCD/Tree/QGl-QGl).  

I can draw the diagrams but when it comes to calculate the amplitude I
get this error:  

SharedObjects::failmsg: Error\! FeynCalc has encountered a fatal problem
and must abort the computation. The problem reads: SUNFIndex is not
allowed inside SUNIndex  

What am I missing? what do I have to change so that the contraction
works?  

Thanks a lot,  
Francesco.
