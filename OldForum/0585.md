Yes, you can.  
You will get some (irrelevant) error message when you use the  
current version with Mathematica 7, but most things should work (except
the documentation does not show up in the Help).  

As time permits I am working on an upgrade for Mathematica 7.  

I would like to apologize to everybody that things go so slowly,  
but I do this in my free time. (If someone wants to invite and pay  
me for a couple of weeks to speed things up, let me know).
