I am trying to evaluate matrix elements separately for the longitudinal
and transverse polarizations of outgoing vectors, and this requires
contracting against two separate matrices of the polarization sums. If I
was evaluating the polarizations together, I would just do
Contract[\<\<\>\>], but that doesn't work for what I want to do.
So my question is: how do I assign Lorentz indices to these matrices, or
otherwise contract these Lorentz tensors?  

Thanks for any help\!
