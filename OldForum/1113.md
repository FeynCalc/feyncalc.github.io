The polarization sum for a massless vector in vacuum may be replaced as
follows: sum\_{polarizations} epsilon\_mu epsilon\*\_nu -\> -g\_{mu
nu}  
However, for a massless vector in a dense medium of charge carriers, the
longitudinal and transverse polarizations are inequivalent. We have
instead: sum\_{polarizations, T} epsilon\_mu epsilon\*\_nu -\>
delta\_{ij} - k\_i k\_j/k\_m dot k\_m (where i, j, m are spatial indices
only) and sum\_{polarizations, L} epsilon\_mu epsilon\*\_nu -\> -g\_{mu
nu} + k\_mu k\_nu/k\_rho dot k\_rho - delta\_{ij} + k\_i k\_j/k\_m dot
k\_m  
So when I contract a Dirac trace against the photon polarizations, I
have something other than a metric tensor or a vector to deal with
(since I have to separate the spatial and temporal components to
calculate the transverse mode).  

Please let me know if this is enough information, otherwise I can
explicitly construct the trace I am interested in.  

Thank you for your help,  
Sam
