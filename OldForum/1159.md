This one seems to be the oldest question (16 years old) on this mailing
list without a satisfying answer.  

I checked the integral with the current dev version and FeynHelpers and
agree with the OneLoopFPI output  
up to the relative sign in front of the 4:  

$LoadAddOns = {"FeynHelpers"};  
<<FeynCalc\`  

SP[p, p] = pp;  
int = 1/(I Pi^2) FAD[{p - k}, {k, mW}] GSD[k];  
res1 = OneLoop[k, int]  
(PaXEvaluate[16 Pi^4 res1, PaXImplicitPrefactor -\> 1/(2 Pi)^D,  
    PaXSeries -\> {{pp, 0, 0}}] /. {ScaleMu^2 -\>  
     ScaleMu^2 E^EulerGamma/(4 Pi),  
    1/Epsilon -\> 2/Epsilon}) // Simplify  

One should also mention that it is very easy to make a mistake here, if
one just naively  
puts p^2 to zero in B0:  

(PaXEvaluate[  
    16 Pi^4 res1 /. B0[FCI@SP[p, p], 0, mW^2] -\>
B0[0, 0, mW^2],  
    PaXImplicitPrefactor -\> 1/(2 Pi)^D,  
    PaXSeries -\> {{pp, 0, 1}}] /. {ScaleMu^2 -\>  
     ScaleMu^2 E^EulerGamma/(4 Pi),  
    1/Epsilon -\> 2/Epsilon}) // Simplify  
      
This is because B0 is multiplied by 1/p^2, so one would loose a finite
contribution when doing so.  
I guess this is what might have happened to OP.  

Cheers,
