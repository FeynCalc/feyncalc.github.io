Rolf,  

Thanks for the variation of the notebook. I have two questions:  

1\. Does FeynCalc have functions that allow for the analysis of the two
point  
integrals A0, B0 etc. in the limit D -\> 4+e so that the divergent parts
of  
the self energies can be extracted and analysed?  

2\. Is it possible to use TARCER to perform the same calculation as done
in  
my notebook but for two loop diagrams? My attempt to do this is in the  
attached file. I have tried applying ToTFI to the results of CreateFCAmp
but  
very few of the terms correctly reduce to TFI form. I deduce from
looking at  
the results from ToTFI that the problem lies at least partly in the
fact  
that ToTFI does not deal with terms with numerators containing odd
powers of  
the internal loop momenta q1 and q2. Presumably these terms are zero
by  
symmetric integration. Are there TARCER functions that allow for these
terms  
to be handled (some sort of analogue of OneLoopSimplify)?  

Many thanks  
Jon Palmer
