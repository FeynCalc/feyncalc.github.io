Ok.  

By the way, the message that FeynCalc issues concerning
TraditionalForm,  
is actually not a warning, just a recommendation.  

Those recommendations can be turned of with  
$FCAdvice = False;  

either before loading FeynCalc, or in FCConfig.m  

We respect that some people prefer to use the StandardForm output  
instead of TraditionalForm ;)  

Cheers,  
Vladyslav
