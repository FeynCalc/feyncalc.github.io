Hi,  

        I have made a lot of fun in learning "FeynCalc". Today when I
use  
the function
"GluonPropagator[q,\\[Mu],a,\\[Nu],b,Gauge-\>{Momentum[n],  
\\[Lambda]}]", I find that the definition of the gluon
propagator in axial  
gauge seems wrong, according my knowledge about pQCD. The gluon
propagator  
in axial gauge should be a little different. I will show my reason in
the  
attachment "gluonpropagator.nb".  

Best regards\!  

Ben-Wei Zhang
