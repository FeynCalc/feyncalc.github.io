In FeynCalc 9.3  

DiracSimplify[GA[0,0]]  

gives 1.  

Cheers,

*\> I don't know how to input a single gamma matrix such as \\gamma^0,
\\gamma^1 and so on. In physics, the square of \\gamma^0 satisfies
(\\gamma^0)^2 = 1. However, if I input
"GA[LorentzIndex[0]]", I find that
"DiracSimplify[GA[LorentzIndex[0],LorentzIndex[0]]"
is equal to 4, and if I input "GA[0]", I find that
"DiracSimplify[GA[0,0]" is equal to
"DiracGamma(0).DiracGamma(0)", which is not I expect.*  
*\> Why I can not conduct \\gammma^0 like \\gamma^5? We can see that
"DiracSimplify[GA[5, 5]]" is exactly equal to 1\! It's
wonderful.*  
*\> I want to find a command for \\gamma^0 matrix which works like the
\\gamma^5 case. But I can not find the way. So I really want to get help
from you.*
