Dear George,  
unfortunately, I have not now a good reference to read about it. This
is  
fundamental property of Dirac matrixes, so, any arbitrary 4x4 matrix may
be  
decomposed as linear combination of Dirac matrixes Gamma=I, \\gamma^5,  
\\gamma^{\\mu},\\gamma^5\\gamma^{\\mu}, \\sigma^{\\mu\\nu}. Coefficients
of this  
decomposition may be determined by matrix trace operation (in addition  
divided by 4). You can write your matrix M explicitly as 4x4 table in  
Mathematica, after that you can write Dirac matrixes (for example in  
standard representation) also as tables, after using usual
1/4\*Tr[M.Gamma]  
operation in Mathematica to define coefficients.  

In FeynCalc these coefficients may be presented as numbers (before I
and  
\\gamma^5 or components of four-vectors for other Dirac matrixes, all
may be  
expressed via known decomposition coefficients). You can define in
FeynCalc  
all scalar products values with these four-vectors using known
coefficients  
of matrix M decomposition.  

Sincerely, Dimitry.
