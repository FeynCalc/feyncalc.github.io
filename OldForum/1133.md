I tried your suggestion already and it works.  

However, the result contains a lot of Passarino-Veltman integrals.  

I found the definition of these integral in the manual but the terms
with indices other than zero are quite complicate.  

I found that we can extract these integrals by Write2 function.  

However, I get nothing from this function. How to solve this problem?  

Another question is are there any way to get the analytic expression
directly from OneLoop result? or I have to calculate Passarino-Veltman
integrals term by term.  

Thanks.
