Hi,  

Actually my question about lanhep and calchep if you have any help,  

As the vertex of the 3 gluons in SM : f^abc, already  
found in calchep, I have a new vertex of 2 colored scalars with a
gluon  
proportional to (f^abc + d^abc), where d^abc is the SU(3) symmetric
structure constant.  

f^abc defined for lanhep as f\_SU3^a^b^c.How d^abc will be defined for
lanhep.  

Thanks,  
Safinaz
