you may first define SP[p,p]=m^2;  
then Tr[GS[p].GS[p]]//FCE  
the function FCE could change p^2 to m^2

Ö÷Ìâ£º How do I make following substitution  
  
Suppose I have  
GS[p].GS[p]it gives me  
(p\_slash)(p\_slash), then I take trace  
Tr[%]it gives me  
4p^2  
Now how can I tell mathematica to treat p^2 as m^2 ???  
just typing %/. p^2- \>m^2 or similar think i think does not work...  
  
Pls tell me if I am not clear with my question  
Thank you
