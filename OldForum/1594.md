Hi there,  

I am trying to do some Levi-Civita contractions in D = 3 but it doesn't
seem to work. For example, I can do  

LC[a,b,c,d]LC[a,b,c,e]//Contract  

in D=4 and get the contraction (the metric), but doing  

LC[a,b,c]LC[a,b,e]//Contract  

in D = 3 does not give me the equivalent. I have tried using
SetOptions[LeviCivita, Dimension -\> 3] and replacing LC with
LCD, but ultimately it only seems to work with four index tensors.  

Any ideas how I can implement this for three-index LC's?  

Thanks.
