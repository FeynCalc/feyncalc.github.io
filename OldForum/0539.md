Hi,  
I am using Mathematica 6.0 on a dual CPU quad core Intel Xeon processor
machine. So I see that effectively in linux 64 bit OS, I have 8
effective CPUs. When I run FEYNCALC to do some trace calculations, only
one of them is 100% busy. So I am using only 1/8th of the computing
resources and not getting the multicore support. Is there a possible way
out?  

Best regards,  
Subhendu
