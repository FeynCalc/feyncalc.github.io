Hi Francesco,  

indeed, thanks for your feedback. The Feynarts' ScalarProduct seems to  
appear only in generated models but not in the standard ones like  
SM.mod. I added it to the conversion function, so it should work now

Cheers,  
Vladyslav

the FCFAConvert function doesn't convert properly the scalar products.
In fact, I get some terms like (-k1).(k1 - p2) which is different form
-Pair[Momentum[k1], Momentum[k1 - p2]]. With
this last expression, I can simplify my expression using
ExpandScalarProduct and using Mandelstam variables.*
