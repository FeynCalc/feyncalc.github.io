Dear Vadim,  
thank you for your fixes and comments.  
Here some late answers and remarks:  

FeynArts + FeynCalc + Phi loading is solved in the  
current development version (in CVS); there remain  
a few Mathematica 5.0 issues which will be solved soon.  

    --
    About SimplifyPolyLog: This function is really meant
    for simplifying Feynman parameter integrals. There
    all variables are real and between 0 and 1.
    I do not intend to change this behaviour.
    Also notice: There are much less general simplification
    functions for PolyLog in the general case.
    Some of them you can inspect at:

    Regards,
    Rolf
