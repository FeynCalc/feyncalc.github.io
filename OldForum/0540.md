Hi,  
I have the same question as in  

<[0244.html](0244.html)>  

but the reply on page  

<[0253.html](0253.html)>  

is in some strange encoding and is unreadable on my machine (Win XP,
Firefox 2) Does anyone know how to make it readable?  

Or can anyone else answer the question on 0244.html?  

Cheers  

Anton
