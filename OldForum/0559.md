I agree with you, but this command doesn't works in v6.0.3. I got the
same error in Mathematica... I tried to open the notebooks through the
'Documentation Center \> Installed AddOns' but Mathematica crashes doing
it.  

If somebody has a clue to fix it, please, help me.  

Best Regards.  

Gustavo.
