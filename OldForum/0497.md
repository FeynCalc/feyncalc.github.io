Hi,  
Here are some problems I have found on mathematica 6 when I tried to
load Feynarts and FeynCalc simultaneously.  
I followed all the instruction at link <http://www.feyncalc.org/phi/> to
install and patch them.  
But when I tried to load Feyncalc, it reports that many defined
functions are shadowed in feynarts, such as Loop, FeynAmp, FeynAmpLish,
PropagatorDenominator, FeynAmpDenominator, GaugeXi,
NonCommutative,PolarizationVector,DiracSpinor,DiracTrace. and after it,
there are several functions don't work, for instance MetricTensor,
Contract....., but Feynarts works well.  

However, when I try to do the same thing on mathematica 4.1 with
HighEnergyPhysics-4.1.1.0 and feynarts3.4 version. everything is fine,
both of them work very well.  

Please help me with them.  
Thanks  

Peng Guo
