On the second thought (and after discussing this with Rolf), there is  
probably no reason why EpsEvaluate shouldn't expand things like  
Momentum[p1+p2-p3] etc. by default. So we decided to add this to
the  
development version.  

Thanks to Lingxiao for bringing this to our attention\!  

The change is very trivial, so that you can easily "backport" it to  
Feyncalc 8.2 or use the workaround with MomentumExpand until the new  
version is out.

Cheers,
