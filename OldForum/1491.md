Hi, Vladyslav. Thanks for the fix.  

I'm thinking that in a more general setup only the SumOver[...,  
External] could be dropped from the conjugate amplitude; all of  
the internal ones should be taken into account, in a case of  
quark loops in both the left and the right amplitudes.  

I'm not sure if there can be IndexDeltas with Generation indices  
involved in an internal loop though; if so, then those need to  
be summed over \*before\* the multiplication by the conjugate  
amplitude, because FCRenameDummyIndices will not rename them.  

I agree that qgraf/FORM/color.h combination is more flexible, of  
course. On the other hand it is more bug prone too, so it makes  
sense to double-check it with FeynArts+FeynCalc.
