I am trying to use Tarcer to analyse some two loop self-energy diagrams.
I would like to understand the divergent and finite parts of the
integrals. At first look it seems like TarcerExpand might do the trick
but it seems to have very limited knowledge of basis integrals. I have
two questions:  

1\. Is there a reerence for the derivation of the integral expressions
that TarcerExpand does understand.  
2\. Can TarcerExpand be extended to include other integrals and if so
how?  

Many thanks,  
Jon Palmer
