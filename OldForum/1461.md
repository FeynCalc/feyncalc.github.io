*\> Does FeynCalc have capabilities to contract gamma matrices with

GA[rho][j, k], can I use FeynCalc to transform the
expression into GA[mu] . GA[rho] . GA[nu]? The
nontrivial part is correct ordering of the gamma matrix chain, by
following the contraction of the indices (i, j, k, l) above. Similarly,
I'm wondering if FeynCalc can perform contraction of SU(N) color
matrices with explicit indices, something like SUNT[a][i,
j].*

For SU(N) matrices this is available since FeynCalc 9.2, cf. Sec 3.7
of  
1601.01167  

For the Dirac matrices I remember pushing some initial code into the
dev  
version some time ago, but that was not production ready and not  
sufficiently tested.  

*\> It shouldn't be hard for me to program this myself, but before I
start, I'd like to know if FeynCalc has any built-in functions to handle
such index contractions, similar to what can be done by e.g. FormTracer
(arXiv:1610.09331).*  

Well, if it is not hard for you, then do it, after all FeynCalc is all  
about being extendalbe. BTW, FormTracer can be conveniently employed
to  
process FeynCalc expressions and convert the results back into the  
FeynCalc notation. I remember Anton Cyrol (one of the developers)  
showing me several scripts for doing that were only few lines of extra  
code where needed. You can ask him for details.
