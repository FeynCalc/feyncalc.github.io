Dear FeynCalc users,  

after almost 3 years of development, we (Rolf, Frederik and Vladyslav)  
are proud to announce the stable release of FeynCalc 9.0.0.  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/releases\>  

The changelog is available here:  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/blob/master/FeynCalc/Changelog.md\>  

FeynCalc 9 works with Mathematica 8 and above. To facilitate the  
installation, we developed a new automatic installer that can also  
download FeynArts and patch it for FeynCalc. The installation  
instructions can be found here:  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/wiki/Installation\#st\_automatic\_installation\>  

Since there can be no bug free software, we provide a special branch
on  
GitHub that will contain bug fixes (but no new features) for FeynCalc
9  
until the new version is released:  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/tree/hotfix-stable\>  

The automatic installer uses this branch by default. Apart from that,
we  
of course still have the master branch (development version aka  
"NightlyCalc")  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/tree/master\>  

which will contain new and experimental features. The automatic  
installer can be also used to install NightlyCalc  

\<https://github.com/FeynCalc/feyncalc/wiki/Installation\#dev\_automatic\_installation\>  

for all those who like the bleeding edge.  

The preprint of the accompanying paper is available here:  

\<<http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01167>\>  

Development of FeynCalc costs of a lot of effort and is done on a  
largely voluntarily basis. To support the developers and increase
their  
academic visibility, please acknowledge our work when you use FeynCalc  
in your research. You can do so by citing the two FeynCalc papers:  

1\) V. Shtabovenko, R. Mertig and F. Orellana, "New Developments in  
FeynCalc 9.0", TUM-EFT 71/15, arXiv:1601.01167  

2\) R. Mertig, M. BÃ¶hm, and A. Denner, "Feyn Calc -
Computer-algebraic  
calculation of Feynman amplitudes",  
Comput. Phys. Commun., 64, 345--359, 1991.  

Last but not least, we would like to thank all of you for your bug  
reports, suggestions and encouragements.  

Best regards,  
FeynCalc Developer Team
