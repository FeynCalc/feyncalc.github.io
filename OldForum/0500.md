Hello,  

I tried to find a general expression for a tensor integral using  
Feyncalc. To test the result, I performed an especially easy  
contraction where one can calculate the result by hand. Unfortunately  
I reproduced the result only up to an additional summand of 1/2.  

I then tried to find where I made a mistake. Finally I figured out  
that there is obviously a problem with Feyncalc. Maybe it is related  
to Bug \#4, but it is somehow different.  

Using the following mathematica code, the problem becomes obvious  
already in this very simple case:  

LoopFunc =  
 FVD[q, \\[Mu]] FVD[q, \\[Nu]]  
  FAD[{q, Subscript[m, 0]}, {q + Subscript[p, 1],
Subscript[m, 1]}]  

test1 =  
 OneLoop[q,  
  Contract[MTD[\\[Mu], \\[Nu]] LoopFunc ,  
   OneLoopSimplify -\> False] ]  

test2 = Contract[  
  MTD[\\[Mu], \\[Nu]] OneLoop[q, LoopFunc,  
    OneLoopSimplify -\> False] ]  

diff = PaVeReduce[(test1 - test2)]  

Can you please comment on this. Maybe it is already known. Or you can  
advice me, what I should not do using these functions since I do not  
know why this problem occurs.  

best regards,  
Sascha
