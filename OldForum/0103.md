The gz extension means that the file has been cmpressed with gnu zip  
(gzip). To uncompress on a UNIX/Linux system, use the command gunzip;  
e.g. "gunzip Moeler. nb.gz". On a Windows system, use WinZip or
WinRar.  
On MacOS, use StuffIt Expander.  

But please notice that the notebooks are not fully in sync with the  
current development version of FeynCalc, a few command have changed  
name. For new oficial version and updated examples in sync with it,  
please wait till December.
