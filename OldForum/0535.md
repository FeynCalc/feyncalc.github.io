Hi,  

In advance I want to thank any help and sorry if my question is silly
but I am new in FC.  

Currently I am using FC to evaluate traces like:  

d1[a\_, b\_, c\_] :=  
 Tr[GSD[a].GAD[\\[Alpha]].GSD[a +
b].GAD[\\[Mu]].GSD[  
    a + b + c].GAD[\\[Nu]].GSD[a +
b].GAD[\\[Alpha]]]  

and what I want is to replace any argument of the function with a four
vector defined in the following way:  

e\*P[\\mu]+f\*k[\\mu]  

where e and f are scalars to be defined later. The above expression
comes from a Sudakov-type decomposition of the original vectors.  

Thanks again for any help.
