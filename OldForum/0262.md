Hello, I have just worked with FeynCalc, and I ran into a problem.  

If I have an expression, say a combination of different momente -
external - incomming as well as outgoing - for a fermionic feynman
diagram, and i wish to use the Dirac equation for the diagram to reduce
the expression -  

how do I get RID of the spinors Ive introduced to simplify the
expression? It seems impossible to rid of the Spinors once you've
introduced them  

\---------------  

A very simple example of the problem:  

SpinorUbar[p1,m].(DS[p]+DS[q]-m).SpinorUbar[p2,m]  
\= SpinorUbar[p1,m].DS[q].SpinorUbar[p2,m]  

Now how do you remove the spinors? If you have a very big expression -
it wont be possible to remove them manually\!
