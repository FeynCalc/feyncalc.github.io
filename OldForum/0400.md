While I have not used MathCode C++,  
I cannot imagine how it would speed up anything in FeynCalc.  
After all the time is needed in the algebraic  
operations like Expand, Collect, etc. . MathCode does not help there.  

If you need speed, just use FORM:  
<http://www.nikhef.nl/~form/>  
and, depending on what you want to do, FormCalc:  
<http://www.feynarts.de/formcalc/>  

You can also easily read in FORM-results into FeynCalc:  
<http://www.feyncalc.org/FeynCalcBook/FORM2FeynCalc/>  

Mostly the algorithms you use are more important than pure speed,  
but sometimes (e.g. lengthy 3-loop calculations) there is just no  
reasonable alternative to FORM (well, I have been told that people  
used Mathematica on 256-CPU-Grid-clusters, and then you can also  
do a lot, but the standard in research seems to be that  
people use FORM).

P.s.: I have a long time ago used the Mathematica function Run  
to execute FeynCalc-generated Shell-Scripts running FORM  
on NextStep - machines. And then read the results into FeynCalc.  
This is really easy and combines the strengths of both systems.
