The clarification regarding the regularization came from John Dixon.
I'm  
not working on SUSY ...  

I'm afraid there is no forum for FormCalc questions. One can contact
the  
main developer  
if one finds some bugs, but AFAIK he is usually not inclined to answer  
basic questions on how to use the program in the way we do it here. I  
guess you are on your own with it.  

Cheers,
