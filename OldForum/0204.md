Dear Bob,  

        thank you for your explanation. Are there Hopf algebra methods
and  
recently made advances also implemented in FeynCalc? The package Rafal
and  
I developed, benefitted is speed and conceptual design cery much from
Hopf  
algebraic techniques.  
        From a technical point of view, its algorithmically more sound
to  
try to work in the Epstein-Glaser (etc pp) framework and \*not\* in
the  
momentum (Feynman graph) picture, since the physical process is split
up  
in an infinite series of integrals to be evaluated. AFAIK Hopf
algebraic  
techniques seem to be the only way to come up with concise \_and\_  
algorithmically effective solutions.  

        I am off for three weeks, and will look into FeynCalc, I can  
imagine to help withits portation to AXIOM though for several personal  
reasons. If you are interested in the things I have in mind, you may  
consider the recent JPysA article on Quantum fieldtheory and Hopf
algebra  
cohomology, by Brouder,BF,Frabetti and Oeckl. Many of the calculations  
there were checked by the above mentioned package, though it was
\_not\_  
designed for that purpose.  

ciao,  
BF.  

PS:

*\> Schroeder*  

Would you really make this a claim? I still think, that without expert  
knowledge one cannot derive even simple results out of these
sources...
